DoctorDragon,13 December 2023,"The ending of Attack on Titan leaves viewers without much explanation, which is the main reason I read negative reviews among people.It's only natural that there are these two opposing viewpoints: some people like to be able to reason about what happened and reflect to figure out what the true message of the series was, with their own interpretation, while others want to be guided to the underlying message by the viewing experience itself.So I decided to illustrate my point of view, constructed by reasoning with multiple people and observing various perspectives:Eren dies when he kisses Historia's hand in season 3. From that moment, he sees the massacre that will happen, and he asks to himself...how is it possible for me to do such a thing? At the end of season 3 we see him pointing his finger across the sea and wondering if that is the solution. There we already had the clue about the character's evolution, with his gaze lost in the void and the future. When talking to Armin, we see that Eren tries to explain to him how he reasoned about his actions. He tried to change things, but everything converged there, and so he wondered what was the purpose, the reason for everything.The answer? There isn't one. He didn't do it for his friends because some died, he didn't do it for an everlasting peace because there is no such thing, it is a utopia. He then wonders if he is just a fool with divine power...but that is not the case too.Since he knew the future, he no longer had any freedom of choice.This is the cornerstone of the argument! He lost his freedom. And it is not a justification for the atrocities he did, but an indictment of war itself, the cause of all evil. Eren became a puppet of hatred and war.... And all that for a kiss on a hand.There was never any plan by Eren, because what ruled his actions were not his choices, and this from the very beginning of season 4! The author made us believe in a plan...which was really just fate itself. A ""dark fate"" we might say.I find this ending brilliant, a poem of horror and fatalism.Having finished the reasoning part, I would like to mention the wonderful animation, music and dubbing of the characters (original version). There were some truly breathtaking and tremendously emotional scenes: Armin scolding himself by looking at his motionless body, the baby in the crowd, the team-up of Levi and Mikasa, all the scenes in the credits, ...If you have read this far, I would like to thank you for your time and hope that this review helped you to better understand one of the perspectives of this complex and colossal episode.",10
IPyaarCinema,12 December 2023,"Attack on Titan is the most intricate and well-crafted piece I have ever come across. Its first season serves as a blueprint for creating a complex, meticulously planned series. Attack on Titan is a masterpiece that takes you on an emotional roller-coaster. From the thrilling plot twists to the intricately crafted characters. It'll have you on the edge of your seat from the very first episode. Set in a world where mankind is locked inside walls to protect themselves from towering human-eating giants, the colossal walls that serve as humanity's last line of defense against the Titans are a constant reminder of how precarious their existence is. The visual depictions of these towering giants - with their grotesque facial features and eerie movements - add to the dark and suspenseful atmosphere of the series, drawing you into its world.As the narrative progresses, the secrets of the Titans' origins and the world's true nature begin to reveal themselves, creating an atmosphere of intrigue that leaves viewers wanting more. Careful pacing ensures that each plot point is well-executed, allowing the story to gradually unfold toward an explosive conclusion. Animation and visual design Attack on Titan is a delight to behold. The animation captures the characters' movements perfectly, especially during those heart-stopping vertical battles. From the city within the walls to the lush forest outside to the eerie scenes of the Titan encounters, everything is beautifully animated.The characters are a big part of what makes it so great. They all feel super real, even the minor ones who don't stick around long. But Eren? He's probably my favorite protagonist ever. No, - he's my favorite character, period. There's something about his journey, his determination, and how he evolves that just resonates with me. Alongside Eren, his childhood friend Mikasa and Armin bring warmth and companionship to the table. Attack on Titan's character development is one of the show's strengths. Of course other than that trio, you have Zeke, Reiner, Annie , Levi, Erwin.. I could go on and on. They each have their place in the show and they perfect the role. Fantastic characters to commend a fantastic show.The ending of Attack on Titan is perfect because of humanity's imperfections. Humans are complicated and conflicted. There is either simply no reason or explanation as to why people do the things they do. How do you get over the ending of the show you love the most? You don't. The loneliness and emptiness swell up within you, and you find yourself wondering how you will fill the hole that this show left you with. The answer, however, is to keep moving forward.",10
MarvellousApollo,26 November 2023,"The ending dared to amaze
It was New, Fresh, and most importantly challenged what we know of stories!To deliver the final message and that message be that the world will never know peace is something that we are not used to, I'm not saying it's unique to AOT, but this is rarely seenEren and Armin's last conversation was Peak.For armin, instead of him saying ""thank you for being a mass murderer for our sake"" it was turned to ""I'll join you in hell"" it's a simple change of dialogue that delivered what isayama intended. The way Eren realizes that he activated the rumbling for one thing and one thing only, his own selfish desires! This scene was done well in the manga, but the anime elevated it to a whole new level!AOT is an exceptional piece of art, from the world building to the characters, plot, story, depth and complexity this was a unique journey from start to finishI have so many things to say about AOT and the final episode and I will never stop talking about them, but for now here where I'll stop talking!""To the boy who sought freedom, goodbye""",10
murphyodhran,24 November 2023,"My favourite show of all time. This conclusion was incredible, simply spectacular. Only real criticism I have about this finale is that they used a small bit too much 3d CGI rather than classic 2d animation (rip wit studio) but my main issue with this ending is that the huge fight scene at the end was done very well but the whole aftermath and the impact it had wasn't depicted very well and seemed a tad rushed. I'd bring my score to a 9 if we got a simple scene explaining where some characters are now, for example Rico and woerman (call them irrelevant idc). Or maybe showing us what Paradis island looked like at the end of the rumbling.",8
lilag-80710,24 November 2023,"What a horrible idea that ""the genocide can be justified by the goal"". And it bothers me that a show that spent 10 years accumulating emotional credibility and influence ended up planting an ideological bomb in the minds of many viewers. No, for me Eren crossed the line. The goal does NOT justify the means.""There was no other choice"", ""everything is ambiguous"". We hear this rhetoric in modern propaganda today. But did Eren and Zeke have a choice? Yes.1. Throughout the series, Eren was a slave to his anger. Gabi was able to overcome her anger, but Eren could not. In the finale, Eren admitted that he simply wanted to raze the world to the ground. This monstrous desire has nothing to do with protecting Paradise. Eren could not attack Marley, but come there and offer peace. The series did not show any convincing attempts to make peace. In fact, Paradise made friends with a technologically advanced country that already surpassed Marley's strength. All that had to be done was to master technology to protect the island. If Marley had tried to attack, Paradise would have repulsed the attack. Other countries would see that Paradise was only defending itself. And since Marley's militaristic greed had already gotten to everyone, other countries could side with Paradise. Instead, the attack on Marley turned all countries against Paradise. These are Eren and Zeke's destructive actions and could have been avoided.2. Zeke's goal is to stop the war by reconciling everyone with the Eldians (at the cost of the sterility of the Eldians). However, he participated in the devastating attacks on Paradise and then approved the attack on Marley (eventually rallying everyone in hatred against the Eldians). This plan is counterproductive and stupid.Instead, Zeke could accumulate authority and influence in Marley and use this to gather like-minded people who want peace. Targeted elimination of war fanatics.The finale admires Eren (aw, he sacrificed his own happiness; bequeathed a ""new world"", what a plan he pulled off). Sentimentally flew in the form of a bird, how touching. A mass murderer gains the aura of a hero.I respected this great show for honesty in depicting difficult issues. But some its ideas and conclusions are terrible. Still we are free to disagree with them.",2
arunchittalil-46160,23 November 2023,"This episode from Attack on Titan is the best episode I have ever watched. Its like a watching a movie. There are some changes in dialogue placement from manga it makes anime more easier to understand. The visuals are top class as always Especially the odm gear sequences. Mikasa and Levi fighting together to get near to Erens founding Titan is truly a visual treat . Some facial expressions look weird (jeans Eren's and Armin) . They used some of the old soundtracks that gives us nostalgic vibe. The sound tracks of attack on titan is a masterpiece it's always give us goosebumps. There is a scene where Mikasa's and Erens voice actors singing together that is a wonderful scene and I love the song too. The ending is heartbreaking. I always expected a confession scene from Eren from season one now it's happened, but it made me cry . Never love a character as much as Eren and Mikasa . Their cabin scenes made me a little happy. This the best ending Attack on Titan needed . Overall
-Animation 10/10
-Soundtracks 10/10 (They should have used T-KT and call of silence somewhere)
-Action 10/10.",10
diko-55552,20 November 2023,"The plan was apparently ""murder 80% of the world, so the Alliance looks like the good guys"", but in the next breath we are told that they're just going to take their revenge--""This fight won't end until either the Eldians or the rest of the world are wiped out."" The idea that the Alliance looks like the good guys is ridiculous: no one could believe that their victory over the unstoppable Eren was legitimate (which it wasn't, he lets them win), Paradis is still largely Yeagerist, and the battle itself wasn't observable by non-Eldians. On the other hand, killing 80% of the world just to delay war with the other 20%, is also a terrible justification for genocide. Why stop at 80%? Going by early 1900s estimates, Eren will have killed over 1 billion people, leaving 200-500 million against Paradis's meager 1 million. That's like Fiji vs the United States; Paradis does not stand a chance.The politics involved were too complex for Eren to figure out on his own, it seems. So why didn't he get advice from his genius best friend about it? Why did he talk to Floch & Historia? If he's worried that his friends will oppose him, maybe it's because they have a point and he should take their advice. If he can't stop himself anyways, there's not really any reason not to tell them either.This guy, having never expressed an iota of romantic affection for Mikasa, tells us he loves her only after he's dead.Knowing how the Rumbling would turn out, what was the point of all the collateral damage in the Liberio operation? The Liberians are some of the few people to survive the Rumbling, and likely to hold enmity for it. Taking the Warhammer Titan power seems largely wasted.There's no point to the time shenanigans.Eren seeing the future ultimately didn't change his plans. He still would have pushed forward to start the Rumbling, except his failure to complete it would make more sense.Did Eren even try to change the future? He could see the future, but does he know that it can't be changed?Did he need to influence the past? Knowing that Dina ate his mom and Grisha killed the Reiss family, what is the purpose in going back and making them do it?To be clear, my issue isn't that the future and past cannot be changed. It's that Eren had no motivation to do what he saw. He just did them because he saw them. Like a monkey would.Similarly, we abandon Historia for everything post-Uprising. That arc revolved around putting her in power, and once she's queen she does nothing except get pregnant. The story cuts to her every now and then to remind us she's pregnant, but nothing ever comes of it.It is difficult to tell what, if any, effect Hange's sacrifice had, which isn't a satisfying way to send off a character.The behavior of the Past Titans and Zeke is bizarre.Zeke, who was opposed to the Rumbling to begin with, could have ended the Rumbling at any time by just exiting Paths and running away or killing himself. He just didn't until Armin told him to.All of Zeke's friends, who were opposed to the Rumbling to begin with, could have helped the Alliance at any point, but didn't until Armin told them to.Only Zeke's friends decided to help. None of the other Past Titans wanted to stop the Rumbling.The Progenitor Hallucigenia started this whole thing and we know nothing about it. No one even gives it an in-universe name. We have to refer to it with nicknames.Is it natural? Magical? Is it the devil? Is there another one? Could it create another Founding Titan? Did it choose Ymir or was it an accident? This thing kicked off the entire mythos of the series and we know nothing about it and no one seems to care.Its behavior in the final battle is bizarre.When Eren's head is blown off, Reiner is somehow able to hold off the spine, which decided to stop growing once it reached about 50ft.When his head is blown off, it turns out the spine actually was the progenitor hallucigenia, and now it is somehow alive, disconnected, and independent for the first time in 2000 years. Its objective is apparently to reconnect with Eren's head. However, instead of running toward Eren in the aftermath of the explosion when everyone else is winded, it runs away to gather an army of titans to clear a path.Why was it so important to get to Eren's head when shifters can move their consciousness?It takes its horde of titans and bullrushes Reiner, Annie, and Pieck so it can get back to Eren. Despite the overwhelming force (the titans could just pick everyone up and run forward), they are still able to hold off the spine.Hallu-chan goes away. It just disappears without a trace and no one comments on it. It survived without a host before Ymir, why not now?Ymir's actions are incomprehensible
How much of the Rumbling was her and how much was Eren? During the final battle, did she build the Alliance's titans just so they could attack her? Did she have any agency at all besides choosing Eren over Zeke? The whole Ymir-Zeke-Eren love triangle doesn't seem to follow any particular rules.What was her motivation? Love? Love for perpetual abuser, projected onto Mikasa's obsession? Why is she gone? Because Mikasa kissed Eren? Ymir has had sex (most likely not consensual), but kissing is what placates her? Or was it her killing Eren?It seems that it functions like some kind of a fairy tale, where some single simple action just stops the curse without any real intermediary steps. If Mikasa killing Eren solved it, does that mean Ymir needed Mikasa to show her how to move on past her love? Was there no one else in 2000 years who could do that? So what did Eren accomplish when he convinced her to oppose the royal bloodline (i.e. Zeke) in 122? And how does this end the Titans? Was she only making titans for the last 2000 years specifically to be slaves to the royal bloodline?Why did Ymir make titans according to human rules? Why did she make titans for the Marleyans, who opposed the royal bloodline? Why was it difficult for a shifter to shift multiple times consecutively? What determined the rules that governed the titans at all?In the end she just goes away, like the worm, without a trace.The main objective of the Alliance vs Founder battle is nonsensical.For some reason, the spine is exposed on this Titan. It appears that his head and body spawned separate titan sections. If the head was truly a weak point, it is unclear why it never fully reattached to the body.Eren's head is detached twice, and the Alliance still views Eren's head as the main objective, assuming it needs to be severed a third time to win.AND SOMEHOW THEY'RE RIGHT?!Eren decides to take Colossal Titan form for some reason.It is unclear why he hid his head in his mouth. It is further unclear how Mikasa knew the head was in the mouth.Things just sorta stop and go away.Pure titans reverted back to normal. So that rather undercuts the pathos from 138, as well as 119.Titans are gone entirely. Now Paradis is basically defenseless. Thanks, Ymir.Apparently the Founding Titan can alter an Ackerman's memories, they just never did until Eren.In the end, nothing is accomplished. The war continues. Eren's genocide was pointless. In fact, it might have just made the remaining peoples hate Paradis more. Again, why would you half-ass a genocide?I tried to keep this criticism as objective as possible (inasmuch as criticism can be objective). I'm not angry that there wasn't a downer ending, or that Eren died; I'm upset that it was poorly written. I wanted to say good things about Attack on Titan's ending, but like many endings to stories that started great, it crumbled under its own weight. It happened to Mass Effect, Game of Thrones, Promised Neverland, and now Attack on Titan. Did I miss anything?",1
kudarijanhvi,20 November 2023,"I'm a very huge attack on titan fan since 2019. I've finished the Manga in 2021. I've been waiting for this part for almost 2 years! From the animation till the music it was just perfect! It was a ethereal movie experience! The fight scenes were just amazing! Especially the last fight between armin and eren! I'm so glad they added extra conversation between armin and eren. I was satisfied with their conversation. Cried for 2 hours after eren's death. Cried when mikasa missed him. This story does not have a happy ending as the cycle of war continues. Like they said, you don't expect a horror story to have a happy ending! Still upset that it's over because this story is very dear to me. But I'm glad to witness such a meaningful story! Thank you wit and MAPPA for animating it! Thank you Hajime isayama for creating this wonderful story! Itterasshai Eren.",10
badansazetim,19 November 2023,"I think Isayama had decided from the very beginning to kill Eren by Mikasa no matter what, even if Eren's death would solve nothing. Isayama just wanted AOT to have a mind-blowing tragic ending and didn't care about ruining his masterpiece. I'm not mad at Isayama because those two didn't end up being together, my problem is the necessity of this tragedy.Zeke's euthanasia plan was not more idiotic than Eren's ""master plan"". Eren sacrificed himself but achieved nothing. Neither war ended nor the titan power completely canceled. Although his friends found a life of happiness, Mikasa ended up being depressed and grieving for her love for the rest of her life. Besides the failure of Eren in achieving his goals (= eradicating titans and war), Eren had seen the future, and if he really loved Mikasa, he mustn't have carried out this plan, because I don't think that was a happy ending for Mikasa.Eren reincarnated as a bird? Come on Isayama are you kidding us?Zeke being killed by Levi, especially right after he helped them against Eren, was insane. Levi's promise to Erwin was for the time that Zeke and other people outside the walls were considered the ""enemy"". Besides, if Zeke deserved to get killed, then what about Anny or Rinner? How is it that because of the killing of Erwin, Levi kills Zeke in cold blood but Anny, the one who wiped out the whole of Levi's squad, doesn't get an even slap on the wrist?Historia's pregnancy thing was absolute garbage. She gave birth to a child whose existence serves no purpose in the story. So what was the point of Historia's getting pregnant from a no-named and no-faced farmer who'd even bullied her in the past and Historia clearly had no special feelings about him?What happened to the Hallucigenia? We're supposed to believe that it just disappeared/evaporated with Eren's death or Ymir's freedom. Really? Obviously, this isn't the case because as you know Hallucigenia has existed long before Eren and even Ymir. If the Hallucigenia was the source of titan power, and if it got destroyed somehow, so how is it possible that the kid in the final scene going into that tree means the return of titans?My final word: Although the ending was disappointing, AOT was, is, and will remain a masterpiece.",6
machinegunsword,19 November 2023,"I've been a fan of this series since 2020 and it has moved me like no other. There are handful of TV series and anime I consider masterpieces but Attack on titan manages to stand out among them and becomes something truly special. From the complex narrative, thematic depth, tackling heavy subjects, grey morality, series-long mystery that constantly keeps you intrigued. Phenomenal cast and jaw-dropping twists that constantly keeps you on edge, this series has everything you can expect from a tv series and it delivers all that with beautiful, top-class animation. I was dreading the finale of the series that I love so much but alas, the time has come for me to say goodbye to Aot. The finale managed to not only adapt a divisive ending based on the source material but it improved it tremendously and create a truly powerful,emotional hour of television. Eren's character is cemented as a truly tragic figure and he is condemned for his sins but also embraced by his friends as they say goodbye to the death of ""humanity's"" savior and the biggest monster of the world. Perfect balance of intense, jaw-dropping action and introspective emotional scenes. I was crying for a while after the end. Its hard to believe this series is over. I'm still not over AOT, it'll forever be my no.1 series. Attack on titan is a once in a generation anime masterpiece and is one of the few that truly stands on par with TV goats such as Breaking bad, the wire, the sopranos. Thank you MAPPA and Isayama.",10
andrescalderon-27325,16 November 2023,"I understand the cyclical aspect of what they try to say with the ending...and it doesnt bother me as much as some people. But three things bothers me alot. First, it reminds me so much of the watchmen ending...I mean, the need to villainize someone or something with mass destruction to ensure unity. I'm sure there must be other comics, mangas, graphic novels, film or series that does the same thing and did it first, but to me it reminds me to Watchmen. And it bothers me, because Watchmen did it so much better! Second thing that bothers me is Eren's reaction to his demise. Given the nature of the powers of the attack titan, he was acting so sure of himself, so asertive... just to crack like a little baby in his last moments!? I understand that people can break down, especially in high stake situations like this, but again, given the nature of the powers of the attack titan it seems rather pointless his outburst...point taken Eren was kind of emotional before everything came into motion, but not to that level... it feels out of character and cringe worthy. The need to make a more sympathetic villain is ruining bad guys. The words hero and villain has no meaning in grey areas... not every character must be a merge of the both... to me Eren died for nothing! Again, not because of the cyclical meaning of war among humanity, that i liked it... but he died for nothing in the sense of how he accomplish what he wanted... he died a wimpy villain try to be a martyr and without free will... and thats the last thing I dont like of this ending... if Eren regrets everything that he's done, but can't change it because is ""all for the better"" why not search for a better solution with the same friends that he so fondly remarks as wise and loving? And in the same thought, if he can't change it because of how the powers of the attack titan worked, who put everything in motion?either way, Eren give up his free will as a fool or there's not an answer to all this mess and that is just bad writing. On a technical level the music, the battles and the voice acting, everything was great as always... and the story arcs and closure of other characters were good. It's not a great ending for me, but it's not bad by any means...",5
baluyutdonpaolo-11824,14 November 2023,"I have to say, this actually made me cry especially when Levi's scene at the end, ""Hey guys. Were you all watching that? It seems that this is how it ends. The goal that you all devoted your hearts to."" It gave a lot of feels because he is the lastI noticed that some panels were changed but still fits the story. MAPPA did their best in creating this finale and will improve more once creating the Blu-Ray. I also love the final ODM gear scene of Levi and Mikasa, that scene was awesome. For me, it tells us no matter how peaceful the world is, there will always be conflict.Overall, the final chapters deliver the best ending to this masterpiece. Thank you for 10 years Attack on Titan, it has been an honor to all the fans of this show. The End...",10
xxisooodyxx,13 November 2023,The end of this masterpiece the greatest show ever i've really enjoyed of every episode on this show and now we can say goodbye Attack On Titan amazing from everything plot twist story characters write is really hurt to see ur favorite show end thanks for isiyama for this amazing show we really give us a masterpiece show I really liked it. Really love it i enjoyed a lot in this anime from the first episode to the last everything written from the writer he was a plan for everything in the end i can see he is just on the top one he got the top one and still in the top one thanks for studio mappa and wit to animated this masterpiece.,10
yourlittletsun,13 November 2023,"A realistic ending that left many plotholes. The first time I finished watching this last episode, I was confused and upset that my favorite character died. Well, eventually EVERYONE died in the end right?The animation and nostalgic soundtracks carried this episode. Although, I still wished they could've done better pacing in the anime. It jumped from places to places too quickly. What was that worm? Why was Ymir in love with the abusive King? Did Mikasa WALK all the way back to Paradis??? Was Levi outside Paradis with Gabi and Falco? There are so many questions in my head left unanswered.Even if Eren was being a realistic character during his breakdown, I still wished they erased that from the anime and changed it to a more calming confession. I think the sudden outburst was kind of cringe.I wish they could've find a better reasoning to free Ymir than her sudden LOVE for the KING. Even until now, I still felt weird about it. Sorry, but I just thought Isayama was trying so hard to pull another plot twist that just died like that. Honestly, I believed he had always been a genius with previous seasons. So, what happened in here?Regardless, I still respect Hajime Isayama's work. The unexpected realistic ending gave a punch to the real world. Especially with the never ending cycle of hatred and war. This anime had shown beautiful metaphors and important morals.As an anime-only fan of this series, I couldn't avoid spoilers. Yes, I was spoiled about Eren's death and heard how manga readers hated the ending. After this episode aired, I could see why but I did not hate it nor loved it. I think it's not AOT if it's not painful.Overall, I would give this episode a solid 7.Thank you for the past 10 years of incredible journey, I will miss this series so much.",7
domrlol,11 November 2023,"First I want to start off by saying Attack on Titan is still my favourite show/story of all time. I won't let me not enjoying the conclusion ruin the show. I started watching in 2020 but I have followed the story much closer than most. I watched videos after videos about this show and I eventually became a manga reader in 2021. I joined the hype of the last chapters but unfortunately chapters 137 and onward fall short. I'll explain why I think they are bad and also why the anime plot-wise does it even worse.However I want to start with the good things about this episode, the anime adaptation is stunning. The animation has a massive step up from the previous parts done by MAPPA and doesn't disappoint at all. Some of the scenes in this final episode are some of the best in the series. To go with the visuals the music choices were very good for the most part, bringing back many classics from the WIT days. Unfortunately that's where my pros end.My biggest problem with this ending is the character assassination of Eren. I'm not just talking about the Eren and Armin scene either, Eren makes terrible decisions in the end which I will get to. But before I do that I want to mention the attempt to cover up Eren making bad decisions in the Anime was because he was simply an idiot with too much power. It's disgusting. Either Isayama or someone at MAPPA chose to do this to cover up the flaws of this ending.Let's get into the Eren and Armin conversation and
what the hell happened with the writing. Like a lot of people seem to think, I do not think Erens outburst was in line with his character at all. Sure, Eren always had his moments when he started crying but here he cries about Mikasa. Eren and Mikasa didn't have a romantic relationship at all throughout the series. The only time it's seriously brought up is when Eren asks her ""what am I to you?"", and Mikasa couldn't even confess to him. And before someone says that if she said she loves him that they would run away to the cabin as shown in the ""alternate timeline"", no that is not an alternate timeline, that is simply a memory made by Eren given to Mikasa right before she kills him. He said he hated her, and he meant it, the dialogue was written in a way that he actually meant what he said. Eren Jaeger was retconned. He wasn't pretending in his private conversations with Historia and Floch, he wasn't pretending at the table scene, he wasn't pretending. Eren wanted to free Paradis Island, not just his friends like the Finale makes it out to be. He failed to save Paradis because of his terrible 80% plan. Out of all the options Eren supposedly had tested (the Armin conversation implies this), he picked the worst one. The Euthanasia Plan was better, 100% Rumbling was better and you could put in an argument that the 50 year plan was better also. Eren failed his nation. He killed 80% of humanity (including his own mother) just so all his friends could live long lives (oh wait, except from Sasha). His answer to Armin asking why was that he doesn't know and he just felt like he had to do it. What is that, is that Eren? Really? One of the best main characters I've ever seen has just said that. It gets even worse when he says he is an idiot with too much power, I thought AOT was deeper than this, It's a terrible way to sum up Erens character. Yes Eren was an angry stupid child that wanted to kill in the beginning but he learns that titans are humans and that the humans fighting him are the same as him. When Reiner talks to Eren in the basement about when he said that he would kill him and Bertholdt in the worst possible way, Eren simply says that he vaguely remembers saying that, implying that he doesn't think like that anymore. He isn't just an idiot who kills for the sake of killing, he isn't mentally ill, I don't want to hear this. Armin's famous quote about becoming a monster to overcome one is thrown out the window because it just doesn't fit in anymore. 100% Rumbling was the way to go, I don't want to sound like a maniac but if Eren has already killed so much people with his motivations, what's 20% more? With the 100% Rumbling Eren would have lived and if HE TOLD HIS CLOSEST FRIENDS ON PARADIS they would have lived too. They would have lived without conflict like they ended up in the actual conclusion. Hell, Eren left them in a bad position. The Avengers are literally discussing the possibility of their boat being sunk because they are the ones that have to take responsibility and do peace talks. It was not explained why Eren told Floch and better yet why Floch actually agreed to him after what happened with Erwin. If Floch wasn't stupid he would have said that if you can't even sacrifice Armin then what can you. But thats just bad writing. Eren always planned to destroy the world and Isayama knew of this. It was implied over and over and over throughout the series. Maybe not the biggest evidence but the funniest is when the Rumbling reaches Marley and they spot the Attack Titan, Eren literally says to himself that he will wipe out every last one of them that's on this earth. Why would he lie in an internal monologue. Eren Jaeger was retconned and handled horribly in the Finale. From Hero to Zero couldn't be more true here. He simply failed. Attack on Titan deserved a grim realistic ending and not the Disney one we got. It goes against everything the show has been building up.Founder Ymir is also a victim of bad writing in the finale. She supposedly loved King Fritz (this is fine) and her seeing Mikasa kill Eren set her free. This set her free because she saw Mikasa being able to let go of her love for Eren. But WAIT. No, Mikasa continues to obsess over Eren for the rest of her life so this is really stupid. And okay even if this was just a breaking point for Ymir and she was able to just leave, then why couldn't she have done this earlier. She is the founder, she knows everything that was going to happen, she could have left years ago. Even if she didn't know what was going to happen she had a whole 2000 years to think about it. Isayama are you really trying to tell me that she could have walked away at any minute? This is really bad because either you wrote her to be the biggest idiot of all time and I don't think this was the case judging by what we've seen before the finale or this is terrible writing. And hint hint its the second one indefinitely.Lastly I want to speak about Historia. This is my last factor to this review but there is so much more bad to speak of about the plot in the ending. Historia became a pointless character in S4. Her pregnancy became irrelevant. Why was it such a big deal if it was with a random farmer? Why was she shown given birth during the horrid scenes of the rumbling (which were fantastically done btw)? It's sad to see a very well written character go to waste. Eren and Historia made a lot more sense, they had more in common than Eren and Mikasa ever did and they actually had meaningful conversations between the two of them. It's sad, really sad.Like I said I have plenty more to talk about like the problems with the Alliance (mainly the treatment of Annie) but I think I'll save it.Attack On Titan is still fantastic and I will never forget the rollercoaster of emotions that it gave me until the very end. I absolutely still recommend this show even if you are just interested in action. It has great moments that I will never forget. Overall I still give Attack On Titan a 9.5/10 because as I said I don't want to let the ending ruin it for me.I want to thank WIT and MAPPA for brining this great manga to life. And of course thank you Isayama for this masterpiece, I wouldn't have got through these years without it. That's it from me, if you enjoy the ending then very good for you! I wish I also did, but I hope you were able to understand my points.",4
classher,10 November 2023,The Eren-Mikasa love story aspect was too underdeveloped that it was not a convincing plot point in the last episode. The romance was always glossed over in previous episodes but suddenly it was forcibly used as a main plot device. Armin and Eren talking about love interests in the midst of a world-ending genocide feels absurdly out of place and highly comical. The creators slowly built up Eren's character but instantly abandoned all of that development as it was revealed in Eren's own words that he didn't even know why he fought so hard and why he did what he did and his mind wasn't even his own because it was clouded by the Titan's powers. Characters that did unforgivable stuff albeit not in the scale of the Rumbling were rewarded a happy ending to reunite with loved ones and to live the rest of their lives in peace and prosperity like a fairy tale ending which was an unwelcome 180 degree turn in the atmosphere of hopelessness and horror that was built leading up to the final episode.,2
naghini-31168,9 November 2023,"Alright so listen, I am not a fan of Anime, i've only watched a handful start to finish, maybe 10-15 max. But I do like watching series and no matter anime or not, the way this series was thought of and planned, i mean common, a MASTERPIECE. From start to finish, never a boring episode, storyline absolutely incredible ( I did not read manga or anything , I am just a regular fan of this Anime series) , WOW moments every season with plots so great that I couldn't even imagine. But to end like that, I just can't be upset - it is a perfect ending that i have never seen in other shows. I think the only bad reviews this show can get is from people that wanted it to never end because every season WAS SO GOD DAMN GOOD!.",10
spegani,9 November 2023,"I need to let it sink in for a bit, right now i'd probably give it 9-9.5, but i think after rewatching it i'd like it a lot more. I'm still rating it a 10 right now because of the really awful 1-star reviews though lol.As always, the animation was absolutely GORGEOUS, but that's expected from studio mappa. Also as always i still really enjoy the facial shading that they use (although this is present through this entire season)I really liked the narrative and plot twists they threw in, and from what i heard (and saw) the changes they made while adapting the manga to the anime were really good and made the characters and narrative stronger.",10
jbgshccf,9 November 2023,"Isayama you madman. Whatever that quote says about there is no Genius without a mixture of madness. Yeah they were spot on. I followed the show from beginning to end (including all the annoying 1-2 year breaks and change of Animation house) and to say it was all worth it would be an understatement. AOT is a Epic wild ride of an anime, with Isayama brave enough to ask difficult questions of his audience with such dark, adult & heavy themes such as genocide, nationalism, the consequence of sin and yet he still manages to weave in beautifully layered characters with their own stories about choice, freedom, fear and perseverance in the face of insurmountable odds in such a calculated, well-written way that it almost defies its Anime category and typical conventions of the medium. I highly recommend Attack on Titan.",10
zakmasterson-59436,9 November 2023,"For me I think this is a pretty great ending for this anime overall. While yes I don't thinks it's a perfect ending like some other anime I think it's an ending that leaves the viewer with somewhat of a bittersweet feeling while also giving the viewer a grim reminder of humanity's detrsuctive tendencies which I think is perfect for aot. I see why people dislike this ending but honestly if people were expecting a show like ATTACK ON TITAN one of the most cruel and depressing anime to have a happy go lucky ending where the hero rides off into the sunset they were watching the wrong show.Did it feel a bit rushed ? Yes I'll admit it did, and I thought some scenes during the credits were unnecessary and were kind of beating the viewer over the head with the theme, I think it should've been a bit more subtle however I think the final scene after the credits was awesome.Overall a very good ending to what I would consider to be one of the best shows of all time......",9
gnjwthfyjc,9 November 2023,"This episode had everything. Action, drama, fear, romance, great music, great animation and above all a great ending. This finale was extraordinary and has nothing left to ask. It was sad yet beautiful and showed us how history repeats itself, which what attack on titan has always been about. This ending has explained some questions we had like why when eren began the rumbling, he talked to all subjects of ymir that he was going to kill them, or why he left all eldians and armin and the others use their powers freely. There couldn't have been a better ending. I'm happy to be a part of this show.",9
prathibhanilakshi,9 November 2023,"You may disagree with me, but I have to be honest here. I have loved this series since it started, but I cannot ignore the flaws in this final episode. It ruined the previous themes, introduced new ones without any buildup, destroyed the character arcs, and created many plot holes. It made the whole series pointless, because nothing that happened before mattered in the end. Here are some of the problems I had with this episode:The Hallucigenia's death was illogical. It seemed to die because Eren died, but that contradicts its history. It lived for a long time without a host in a tree before Ymir touched it. It also disappeared out of nowhere, even though it was a huge threat in the previous chapter. The only explanation is that Ymir wanted it to die, but that raises more questions about the origin and power of the founder (which we thought came from the worm).The return of the past shifters to help Armin was a cheap deus ex machina. It had no logical explanation, except to please the fans.Eren ""becoming a bird"" was unnecessary and nonsensical. It was just a symbolic gesture, but it did not fit the final panel.Mikasa's character arc was wasted. She had the courage to kill Eren, but she never moved on from him. She remained obsessed with him for the rest of her life, even when she had a family. What was the point of her growth?Mikasa somehow teleported to Paradis, away from the main cast, and buried Eren's head on the hill where they first met. How did she get there? They had no way to cross the sea. And how did she avoid the Yeagerists, who considered her a traitor and an enemy? I understand that the rest of the cast came to Paradis later, but Mikasa's situation made no sense.Historia's character was ruined. Why did she lie about her pregnancy? Why did she meet with Eren and ask him about her child, but never reveal what they talked about? Why did she look unhappy and depressed while pregnant, as if she did not want the child? Why did she say ""You need to take care of your body"" to the Farmer?The Farmer being the father was disappointing, not because I wanted Eren to be the father, but because there was no development or backstory for him. He was just a random guy who bullied Historia as a child, and then worked on her farm. How did they end up having a child together? How did Historia feel about him? How did he feel about her? The pregnancy was just a plot device to delay the inheritance of the beast titan, but it also destroyed the dignity and agency of the most important female character in the story, the QUEEN.Ymir being in love with King Fritz was a weak explanation for her actions. It was supposed to be Stockholm syndrome, but it did not make sense with her death. If she loved him, why did she let herself die? If she hated him, why did she obey him for 2000 years? And why did she need Mikasa to free her from her love? First Mikasa, then Ymir and Historia, this was a terrible message to the female readers about romance in this story.The rumbling stopping when Zeke was killed was another plot hole, since Ymir was not bound by the royal blood rule anymore. She was on Eren's side, so why did Zeke's death affect her?Ymir Fritz in general was a mystery, so she waited 2000 years for what?",1

The culmination of 10+ years of storytelling reaches its peak in both action and animation and remains unafraid to leave room for resonant, gut punching emotional beats that will linger with the viewer.Breathtaking, beautiful, brutal and bold in it's vision, Attack on Titan brings its story to a resoundingly satisfying conclusion with this final episode.Farewell, AOT. Thank you for your devoted hearts.",10
ak-58186,8 November 2023,"When I first read the leaks for the final chapter , I was disappointed . When I read the Korean raw , I was confused and emotional . When I read the chapter for the first time , I thought it was alright . Looking back and re - reading the chapter with the end of the anime fast approaching , I find myself liking it more and more . I could honestly speak for hours about Attack on Titan and its themes and writing , think the ending is just perfect - is overall good and fits with the themes of the story ,What a great writer
What a great story
What a great ending
Thank you Isayama for this great anime .",10
lindaoueslati,8 November 2023,"The finale was hands down one of THE BEST I've ever seen. The feels, the fights, the details, the animation. A lot of peak thrill scenes. The finale was a whole journey. Three days since its release and I'm still thinking about it, contemplating it, analysing it and rewatching it to absorb all of the details. Those who did not like most likely did not understand it's depth, the message Isayama intended to relay to us, the complexity of the characters and the little details. AOT is too genius to have a simple, straightforward, happy ending. Or else it wouldn't be realistic. This was the most realistic ending given to us. THANK YOU ISAYAMA FOR THIS MASTERPIECE. THANK YOU.",10
tdsearles25,8 November 2023,"We live in a time where a terrible ending to an epic story or a wasted sequel is almost expected now. Writers try too hard. Or they get cocky, lazy, etc. We have seen unacceptable disasters from Game of Thrones, Supernatural, Dexter, Lost, HIMYM and all the way to the direction of Star Wars, Disney remakes and even Marvel nowadays.So, it was refreshing to see Attack of Titan land its ending well. Now, its not perfect, and its a little depressing; but I think most fans will agree it was a mostly satisfying way to conclude this amazing story.The action and writing were fantastic. The tension, emotions, sacrifice, characters. They nailed the important things.Captain Levi stands out as truly one of the greatest characters of all time. This warrior, already a legend, comes back from the brink of death to play a vital role in the final battle, fighting through his injures to save Connie. Taking out Zeke once and for all. And at the very end its down to just him and Mikasa as the only two left. Him helping her get to the mouth to confront Eren. Then when its done he salutes his fallen Scout Regiment members and enters his life of healing and retirement. But still, I wanted more. To see more of his conclusion. Maybe receiving awards or passing on his strength to future generations. Something. I guess its hard to perfectly wrap up anyone's story that was so epicThere's not really much more I can add that hasnt already been highlighed by other fans. But I felt like this was about as good an ending as they could pull off. Thank you to the writers and everyone who made this happen and put together a fantastic and satisfying finish.8.5/10.",8
kroganslayer,8 November 2023,"The character development, the animation and the story, everything is on top of the sky. I don't even think that any other anime can be that amazing as well as engaging in the past or the upcoming years. Never gonna forget this anime, highly recommended or you'll miss this masterpiece. I'm gonna watch this for years. I wonder how did the writer even thought of something this sort of masterpiece, truly a genius. None of the new generation anime even come close to Attack on Titan, like some anime got peak animation, some got peak fights, peak story, peak fiction, etc. But Attack on Titan got every one of those and is highly underrated peak fiction anime.",10
htms-79066,8 November 2023,"The story ends with Eren killing 80% of the world and still being shown as a hero. Something is off. His motivations seem so dark and revengeful and suddenly he becomes the good hero trying to save everyone. The worst part is that every friend of his agrees with him. Sorry, it doesn't make any sense.And Ymir's motivation was because she was in love with the king? So poor writing. It could be anything. She is depicted as a suffering woman in love, while the king doesn't care. He took his tongue off and she was in love? It doesn't make sense as well.They built up a perfect show... until now. A decade waiting for this. Disappointing at least.",1
lanyawshyar-69699,8 November 2023,"Every beginning has an end, and here is the end of the best stories that has ever been released in the anime history.It's been almost 3 years since I first started watching AOT, and the fact that it feels like just yesterday and thats so sad :(.This anime series is a masterpiece,the characters, the unforgettable music, and the high quality of the show, along with the incredible world it creates, everything about this show was more than perfect.The ending... Like many others, I hoped for something different after reading spoilers and imagining alternatives, but witnessing the episode made me see it as the best way to close this incredible show. It's sad to know that Eren is dead, but the ending was still the best.And whether you loved or hated the finale, no one can't deny that Attack on Titan is one of the greatest anime ever made..
And one last time, Shinzo wo Sasageyo!",10
blakeefuller,8 November 2023,Attack on Titan is a story like no other. The journey to get to the end was unforgettable and beyond any expectations I could have ever had. While the ending isn't perfect I find it fitting in the sense it really drives home the message the Author was trying to deliver. It was never the titans that caused conflict. While Eren deserved to die his actions and their results are interesting and not so black and white. I do find by including the extended manga ending it erases the meaning of them since he stopped nothing. In the end this show was never going to have an ending for everyone but it serves its purpose amazingly and put to rest one of the greatest stories I've ever experienced to rest. Thank you for all the memories Attack on Titan.,10
baluyutdonpaolo,8 November 2023,"This is a really fitting end for Attack on Titan. This is exactly how I wanted to end the show; Great Action that leaves you at the edge of your seat, Story that torments/torture everyone, shocking also, and a Conclusion that answers almost everything.It really did copy the manga, but some of the scenes were changed but it still fits in the story. I can see the struggle and desperation of the group to stop Eren and the Founding.At one specific moment, it looks like they're in hell battling Eren and the Founding Titan. They have to stop the two from connecting while seeing their love ones turned into titans and started to attack. ""When will this torment ever end?"" I feel also for the characters as they about to meet their end. As we all know that Hell is a place where they torment or torture people, so the scene played or showed us the torment they had to endure or suffer.Overall, the episode is great. I will miss this one of the masterpiece anime. Thank you for everything. As for the heroes of the story, your sacrifices paid off, at least for a while...",10
finweiskopf,8 November 2023,"I still can't process this ending. This is by far the greatest ending I've ever bore witness to in my entire life and for the rest of my life. Attack on titan has been the greatest experience and is by far in my opinion the best written series there is. I expected nothing less than the great finale we received here. Hajime isayama you're an actual genius and I really don't know how you crafted one of the most beautiful series to exist on this planet but here it is. This show will never be forgotten, truly. I'm genuinely speechless, I'm at a loss for words to describe how amazing and beautiful this series is and I'm left in pure awe. If a series can do this to a person I think you've done the greatest thing you possibly can as a writer, make someone feel something so deep it leaves them at a loss for words from the pure impact of a single episode. Thank you Isayama.",10
matthewtoy-64956,8 November 2023,"Does Eren stop the rumbling? Does he kill everyone else? Neither. He stops where we left off - at 80%. It turns out, he doesn't know why he did what he did, except one thing, that he's still a slave to freedom.In a sense, only a program like AOT could make killing 80% of humanity a ""neutral ending."" Most of humanity and the earth is wasted, and Eren doesn't completely succeed in the Rumbling. This is what makes the ending perfect - in the end, nobody knew exactly what they wanted, and nobody got exactly what they wanted. In essence, the world ends in the same place Paradis began - endless conflict, with nothing really changed.Did Eren and the characters even change anything at a fundamental level? Was the world doomed to chaos with or without the Titans? At least for me, it seems so.",10
francis_angelo_g,8 November 2023,"It truly was a masterpiece. I find it perplexing that it received a one-star rating, as people should evaluate it based on this whole episode rather than letting disappointment over the ending cloud their judgment. The detailed revelation, intense action sequences, thrilling moments, and the exceptional use of sound and visuals. Mappa did a fantastic job in adapting this manga. As a fan, this anime will leave an indelible mark in my memory. My heartfelt gratitude goes out to Isayama and the entire production team, including the writer, sounds, music, voice actors, and visual artists behind this exceptional anime.

old_school_boston,7 November 2023,"I'm so glad i never spent the time reading the manga. I'd be really upset spending that much time on this story to have that utterly terrible ending. I knew as soon as they started mentioning in earlier seasons that Eren could see the future and past that there was no way this was going to have a good ending. The explanations of why are so lazy and cliché. I'm so disappointed because I was very much on the bandwagon of this being one of the best Shonen's out there. With this ending this show pretty much doesn't exist for me, on to the next i suppose. The absolutely only saving factor was that in the end, it was Baseball that saved the world. Go Rangers.",2
rishatkhan,7 November 2023,"I think the killing of 80% of humanities was the only way founder Ymir would get freedom from the path. Thats why she planned all these to reach to this conclusion of Killing Eren With Mikasa's hand what founder Ymir couldn't do which was sacrificing his love for others by Killing king Fritz. I think she controlled every titan from the beginning to find way to get free from the path but failed many time and Mikasa was the only chance Ymir had. I don't think Eren's will mattered or anyone else, only Ymir's freedom mattered even if 80% of the world had to be killed in that process. Some people were saying ""what was the point of Eren killing 80% of the population if they would still get killed after 100 of years"", Thats the point Ymir didn't care if the paradise island would get destroyed after killing 80% of humanity. Ymir only cared of getting free from The Path. *Mind Blowing*",10

mrdarkgaming,7 November 2023,"The main reason for the haight is the devaluation of the entire previous plot of the Attack of the Titans and the transformation of the entire manga into a stupid circus for downs. Everything about Ymir and Eren's murder of his own mother completely deprive the whole story of the Attack of meaning (since Ymir is the cause of the whole batch in general, and the death of his mother is Eren's primary motivation) and it is no longer possible to take the whole manga seriously.The second main reason: Isayama's betrayal of his own professional responsibility for the well-being of his creation and devotion to the idea, a shameful deflection under the worthless wishes of snotty female fans of the characters.Other reasons:1) A change in tone from severely realistic to pink-snotty, which entails huge gaps in logic and leads to a reduction in the plausibility of what is happening to zero.2) The author's disregard for the lore of the universe (Ackermans can overwrite memory, the worm just disappeared somewhere for no apparent reason, and so on, Eren can do something else.",1

DoctorDragon,13 December 2023,"The ending of Attack on Titan leaves viewers without much explanation, which is the main reason I read negative reviews among people.It's only natural that there are these two opposing viewpoints: some people like to be able to reason about what happened and reflect to figure out what the true message of the series was, with their own interpretation, while others want to be guided to the underlying message by the viewing experience itself.So I decided to illustrate my point of view, constructed by reasoning with multiple people and observing various perspectives:Eren dies when he kisses Historia's hand in season 3. From that moment, he sees the massacre that will happen, and he asks to himself...how is it possible for me to do such a thing? At the end of season 3 we see him pointing his finger across the sea and wondering if that is the solution. There we already had the clue about the character's evolution, with his gaze lost in the void and the future. When talking to Armin, we see that Eren tries to explain to him how he reasoned about his actions. He tried to change things, but everything converged there, and so he wondered what was the purpose, the reason for everything.The answer? There isn't one. He didn't do it for his friends because some died, he didn't do it for an everlasting peace because there is no such thing, it is a utopia. He then wonders if he is just a fool with divine power...but that is not the case too.Since he knew the future, he no longer had any freedom of choice.This is the cornerstone of the argument! He lost his freedom. And it is not a justification for the atrocities he did, but an indictment of war itself, the cause of all evil. Eren became a puppet of hatred and war.... And all that for a kiss on a hand.There was never any plan by Eren, because what ruled his actions were not his choices, and this from the very beginning of season 4! The author made us believe in a plan...which was really just fate itself. A ""dark fate"" we might say.I find this ending brilliant, a poem of horror and fatalism.Having finished the reasoning part, I would like to mention the wonderful animation, music and dubbing of the characters (original version). There were some truly breathtaking and tremendously emotional scenes: Armin scolding himself by looking at his motionless body, the baby in the crowd, the team-up of Levi and Mikasa, all the scenes in the credits, ...If you have read this far, I would like to thank you for your time and hope that this review helped you to better understand one of the perspectives of this complex and colossal episode.",10
IPyaarCinema,12 December 2023,"Attack on Titan is the most intricate and well-crafted piece I have ever come across. Its first season serves as a blueprint for creating a complex, meticulously planned series. Attack on Titan is a masterpiece that takes you on an emotional roller-coaster. From the thrilling plot twists to the intricately crafted characters. It'll have you on the edge of your seat from the very first episode. Set in a world where mankind is locked inside walls to protect themselves from towering human-eating giants, the colossal walls that serve as humanity's last line of defense against the Titans are a constant reminder of how precarious their existence is. The visual depictions of these towering giants - with their grotesque facial features and eerie movements - add to the dark and suspenseful atmosphere of the series, drawing you into its world.As the narrative progresses, the secrets of the Titans' origins and the world's true nature begin to reveal themselves, creating an atmosphere of intrigue that leaves viewers wanting more. Careful pacing ensures that each plot point is well-executed, allowing the story to gradually unfold toward an explosive conclusion. Animation and visual design Attack on Titan is a delight to behold. The animation captures the characters' movements perfectly, especially during those heart-stopping vertical battles. From the city within the walls to the lush forest outside to the eerie scenes of the Titan encounters, everything is beautifully animated.The characters are a big part of what makes it so great. They all feel super real, even the minor ones who don't stick around long. But Eren? He's probably my favorite protagonist ever. No, - he's my favorite character, period. There's something about his journey, his determination, and how he evolves that just resonates with me. Alongside Eren, his childhood friend Mikasa and Armin bring warmth and companionship to the table. Attack on Titan's character development is one of the show's strengths. Of course other than that trio, you have Zeke, Reiner, Annie , Levi, Erwin.. I could go on and on. They each have their place in the show and they perfect the role. Fantastic characters to commend a fantastic show.The ending of Attack on Titan is perfect because of humanity's imperfections. Humans are complicated and conflicted. There is either simply no reason or explanation as to why people do the things they do. How do you get over the ending of the show you love the most? You don't. The loneliness and emptiness swell up within you, and you find yourself wondering how you will fill the hole that this show left you with. The answer, however, is to keep moving forward.",10
MarvellousApollo,26 November 2023,"The ending dared to amaze
It was New, Fresh, and most importantly challenged what we know of stories!To deliver the final message and that message be that the world will never know peace is something that we are not used to, I'm not saying it's unique to AOT, but this is rarely seenEren and Armin's last conversation was Peak.For armin, instead of him saying ""thank you for being a mass murderer for our sake"" it was turned to ""I'll join you in hell"" it's a simple change of dialogue that delivered what isayama intended. The way Eren realizes that he activated the rumbling for one thing and one thing only, his own selfish desires! This scene was done well in the manga, but the anime elevated it to a whole new level!AOT is an exceptional piece of art, from the world building to the characters, plot, story, depth and complexity this was a unique journey from start to finishI have so many things to say about AOT and the final episode and I will never stop talking about them, but for now here where I'll stop talking!""To the boy who sought freedom, goodbye""",10
murphyodhran,24 November 2023,"My favourite show of all time. This conclusion was incredible, simply spectacular. Only real criticism I have about this finale is that they used a small bit too much 3d CGI rather than classic 2d animation (rip wit studio) but my main issue with this ending is that the huge fight scene at the end was done very well but the whole aftermath and the impact it had wasn't depicted very well and seemed a tad rushed. I'd bring my score to a 9 if we got a simple scene explaining where some characters are now, for example Rico and woerman (call them irrelevant idc). Or maybe showing us what Paradis island looked like at the end of the rumbling.",8
lilag-80710,24 November 2023,"What a horrible idea that ""the genocide can be justified by the goal"". And it bothers me that a show that spent 10 years accumulating emotional credibility and influence ended up planting an ideological bomb in the minds of many viewers. No, for me Eren crossed the line. The goal does NOT justify the means.""There was no other choice"", ""everything is ambiguous"". We hear this rhetoric in modern propaganda today. But did Eren and Zeke have a choice? Yes.1. Throughout the series, Eren was a slave to his anger. Gabi was able to overcome her anger, but Eren could not. In the finale, Eren admitted that he simply wanted to raze the world to the ground. This monstrous desire has nothing to do with protecting Paradise. Eren could not attack Marley, but come there and offer peace. The series did not show any convincing attempts to make peace. In fact, Paradise made friends with a technologically advanced country that already surpassed Marley's strength. All that had to be done was to master technology to protect the island. If Marley had tried to attack, Paradise would have repulsed the attack. Other countries would see that Paradise was only defending itself. And since Marley's militaristic greed had already gotten to everyone, other countries could side with Paradise. Instead, the attack on Marley turned all countries against Paradise. These are Eren and Zeke's destructive actions and could have been avoided.2. Zeke's goal is to stop the war by reconciling everyone with the Eldians (at the cost of the sterility of the Eldians). However, he participated in the devastating attacks on Paradise and then approved the attack on Marley (eventually rallying everyone in hatred against the Eldians). This plan is counterproductive and stupid.Instead, Zeke could accumulate authority and influence in Marley and use this to gather like-minded people who want peace. Targeted elimination of war fanatics.The finale admires Eren (aw, he sacrificed his own happiness; bequeathed a ""new world"", what a plan he pulled off). Sentimentally flew in the form of a bird, how touching. A mass murderer gains the aura of a hero.I respected this great show for honesty in depicting difficult issues. But some its ideas and conclusions are terrible. Still we are free to disagree with them.",2
arunchittalil-46160,23 November 2023,"This episode from Attack on Titan is the best episode I have ever watched. Its like a watching a movie. There are some changes in dialogue placement from manga it makes anime more easier to understand. The visuals are top class as always Especially the odm gear sequences. Mikasa and Levi fighting together to get near to Erens founding Titan is truly a visual treat . Some facial expressions look weird (jeans Eren's and Armin) . They used some of the old soundtracks that gives us nostalgic vibe. The sound tracks of attack on titan is a masterpiece it's always give us goosebumps. There is a scene where Mikasa's and Erens voice actors singing together that is a wonderful scene and I love the song too. The ending is heartbreaking. I always expected a confession scene from Eren from season one now it's happened, but it made me cry . Never love a character as much as Eren and Mikasa . Their cabin scenes made me a little happy. This the best ending Attack on Titan needed . Overall
-Animation 10/10
-Soundtracks 10/10 (They should have used T-KT and call of silence somewhere)
-Action 10/10.",10
diko-55552,20 November 2023,"The plan was apparently ""murder 80% of the world, so the Alliance looks like the good guys"", but in the next breath we are told that they're just going to take their revenge--""This fight won't end until either the Eldians or the rest of the world are wiped out."" The idea that the Alliance looks like the good guys is ridiculous: no one could believe that their victory over the unstoppable Eren was legitimate (which it wasn't, he lets them win), Paradis is still largely Yeagerist, and the battle itself wasn't observable by non-Eldians. On the other hand, killing 80% of the world just to delay war with the other 20%, is also a terrible justification for genocide. Why stop at 80%? Going by early 1900s estimates, Eren will have killed over 1 billion people, leaving 200-500 million against Paradis's meager 1 million. That's like Fiji vs the United States; Paradis does not stand a chance.The politics involved were too complex for Eren to figure out on his own, it seems. So why didn't he get advice from his genius best friend about it? Why did he talk to Floch & Historia? If he's worried that his friends will oppose him, maybe it's because they have a point and he should take their advice. If he can't stop himself anyways, there's not really any reason not to tell them either.This guy, having never expressed an iota of romantic affection for Mikasa, tells us he loves her only after he's dead.Knowing how the Rumbling would turn out, what was the point of all the collateral damage in the Liberio operation? The Liberians are some of the few people to survive the Rumbling, and likely to hold enmity for it. Taking the Warhammer Titan power seems largely wasted.There's no point to the time shenanigans.Eren seeing the future ultimately didn't change his plans. He still would have pushed forward to start the Rumbling, except his failure to complete it would make more sense.Did Eren even try to change the future? He could see the future, but does he know that it can't be changed?Did he need to influence the past? Knowing that Dina ate his mom and Grisha killed the Reiss family, what is the purpose in going back and making them do it?To be clear, my issue isn't that the future and past cannot be changed. It's that Eren had no motivation to do what he saw. He just did them because he saw them. Like a monkey would.Similarly, we abandon Historia for everything post-Uprising. That arc revolved around putting her in power, and once she's queen she does nothing except get pregnant. The story cuts to her every now and then to remind us she's pregnant, but nothing ever comes of it.It is difficult to tell what, if any, effect Hange's sacrifice had, which isn't a satisfying way to send off a character.The behavior of the Past Titans and Zeke is bizarre.Zeke, who was opposed to the Rumbling to begin with, could have ended the Rumbling at any time by just exiting Paths and running away or killing himself. He just didn't until Armin told him to.All of Zeke's friends, who were opposed to the Rumbling to begin with, could have helped the Alliance at any point, but didn't until Armin told them to.Only Zeke's friends decided to help. None of the other Past Titans wanted to stop the Rumbling.The Progenitor Hallucigenia started this whole thing and we know nothing about it. No one even gives it an in-universe name. We have to refer to it with nicknames.Is it natural? Magical? Is it the devil? Is there another one? Could it create another Founding Titan? Did it choose Ymir or was it an accident? This thing kicked off the entire mythos of the series and we know nothing about it and no one seems to care.Its behavior in the final battle is bizarre.When Eren's head is blown off, Reiner is somehow able to hold off the spine, which decided to stop growing once it reached about 50ft.When his head is blown off, it turns out the spine actually was the progenitor hallucigenia, and now it is somehow alive, disconnected, and independent for the first time in 2000 years. Its objective is apparently to reconnect with Eren's head. However, instead of running toward Eren in the aftermath of the explosion when everyone else is winded, it runs away to gather an army of titans to clear a path.Why was it so important to get to Eren's head when shifters can move their consciousness?It takes its horde of titans and bullrushes Reiner, Annie, and Pieck so it can get back to Eren. Despite the overwhelming force (the titans could just pick everyone up and run forward), they are still able to hold off the spine.Hallu-chan goes away. It just disappears without a trace and no one comments on it. It survived without a host before Ymir, why not now?Ymir's actions are incomprehensible
How much of the Rumbling was her and how much was Eren? During the final battle, did she build the Alliance's titans just so they could attack her? Did she have any agency at all besides choosing Eren over Zeke? The whole Ymir-Zeke-Eren love triangle doesn't seem to follow any particular rules.What was her motivation? Love? Love for perpetual abuser, projected onto Mikasa's obsession? Why is she gone? Because Mikasa kissed Eren? Ymir has had sex (most likely not consensual), but kissing is what placates her? Or was it her killing Eren?It seems that it functions like some kind of a fairy tale, where some single simple action just stops the curse without any real intermediary steps. If Mikasa killing Eren solved it, does that mean Ymir needed Mikasa to show her how to move on past her love? Was there no one else in 2000 years who could do that? So what did Eren accomplish when he convinced her to oppose the royal bloodline (i.e. Zeke) in 122? And how does this end the Titans? Was she only making titans for the last 2000 years specifically to be slaves to the royal bloodline?Why did Ymir make titans according to human rules? Why did she make titans for the Marleyans, who opposed the royal bloodline? Why was it difficult for a shifter to shift multiple times consecutively? What determined the rules that governed the titans at all?In the end she just goes away, like the worm, without a trace.The main objective of the Alliance vs Founder battle is nonsensical.For some reason, the spine is exposed on this Titan. It appears that his head and body spawned separate titan sections. If the head was truly a weak point, it is unclear why it never fully reattached to the body.Eren's head is detached twice, and the Alliance still views Eren's head as the main objective, assuming it needs to be severed a third time to win.AND SOMEHOW THEY'RE RIGHT?!Eren decides to take Colossal Titan form for some reason.It is unclear why he hid his head in his mouth. It is further unclear how Mikasa knew the head was in the mouth.Things just sorta stop and go away.Pure titans reverted back to normal. So that rather undercuts the pathos from 138, as well as 119.Titans are gone entirely. Now Paradis is basically defenseless. Thanks, Ymir.Apparently the Founding Titan can alter an Ackerman's memories, they just never did until Eren.In the end, nothing is accomplished. The war continues. Eren's genocide was pointless. In fact, it might have just made the remaining peoples hate Paradis more. Again, why would you half-ass a genocide?I tried to keep this criticism as objective as possible (inasmuch as criticism can be objective). I'm not angry that there wasn't a downer ending, or that Eren died; I'm upset that it was poorly written. I wanted to say good things about Attack on Titan's ending, but like many endings to stories that started great, it crumbled under its own weight. It happened to Mass Effect, Game of Thrones, Promised Neverland, and now Attack on Titan. Did I miss anything?",1
kudarijanhvi,20 November 2023,"I'm a very huge attack on titan fan since 2019. I've finished the Manga in 2021. I've been waiting for this part for almost 2 years! From the animation till the music it was just perfect! It was a ethereal movie experience! The fight scenes were just amazing! Especially the last fight between armin and eren! I'm so glad they added extra conversation between armin and eren. I was satisfied with their conversation. Cried for 2 hours after eren's death. Cried when mikasa missed him. This story does not have a happy ending as the cycle of war continues. Like they said, you don't expect a horror story to have a happy ending! Still upset that it's over because this story is very dear to me. But I'm glad to witness such a meaningful story! Thank you wit and MAPPA for animating it! Thank you Hajime isayama for creating this wonderful story! Itterasshai Eren.",10
badansazetim,19 November 2023,"I think Isayama had decided from the very beginning to kill Eren by Mikasa no matter what, even if Eren's death would solve nothing. Isayama just wanted AOT to have a mind-blowing tragic ending and didn't care about ruining his masterpiece. I'm not mad at Isayama because those two didn't end up being together, my problem is the necessity of this tragedy.Zeke's euthanasia plan was not more idiotic than Eren's ""master plan"". Eren sacrificed himself but achieved nothing. Neither war ended nor the titan power completely canceled. Although his friends found a life of happiness, Mikasa ended up being depressed and grieving for her love for the rest of her life. Besides the failure of Eren in achieving his goals (= eradicating titans and war), Eren had seen the future, and if he really loved Mikasa, he mustn't have carried out this plan, because I don't think that was a happy ending for Mikasa.Eren reincarnated as a bird? Come on Isayama are you kidding us?Zeke being killed by Levi, especially right after he helped them against Eren, was insane. Levi's promise to Erwin was for the time that Zeke and other people outside the walls were considered the ""enemy"". Besides, if Zeke deserved to get killed, then what about Anny or Rinner? How is it that because of the killing of Erwin, Levi kills Zeke in cold blood but Anny, the one who wiped out the whole of Levi's squad, doesn't get an even slap on the wrist?Historia's pregnancy thing was absolute garbage. She gave birth to a child whose existence serves no purpose in the story. So what was the point of Historia's getting pregnant from a no-named and no-faced farmer who'd even bullied her in the past and Historia clearly had no special feelings about him?What happened to the Hallucigenia? We're supposed to believe that it just disappeared/evaporated with Eren's death or Ymir's freedom. Really? Obviously, this isn't the case because as you know Hallucigenia has existed long before Eren and even Ymir. If the Hallucigenia was the source of titan power, and if it got destroyed somehow, so how is it possible that the kid in the final scene going into that tree means the return of titans?My final word: Although the ending was disappointing, AOT was, is, and will remain a masterpiece.",6
machinegunsword,19 November 2023,"I've been a fan of this series since 2020 and it has moved me like no other. There are handful of TV series and anime I consider masterpieces but Attack on titan manages to stand out among them and becomes something truly special. From the complex narrative, thematic depth, tackling heavy subjects, grey morality, series-long mystery that constantly keeps you intrigued. Phenomenal cast and jaw-dropping twists that constantly keeps you on edge, this series has everything you can expect from a tv series and it delivers all that with beautiful, top-class animation. I was dreading the finale of the series that I love so much but alas, the time has come for me to say goodbye to Aot. The finale managed to not only adapt a divisive ending based on the source material but it improved it tremendously and create a truly powerful,emotional hour of television. Eren's character is cemented as a truly tragic figure and he is condemned for his sins but also embraced by his friends as they say goodbye to the death of ""humanity's"" savior and the biggest monster of the world. Perfect balance of intense, jaw-dropping action and introspective emotional scenes. I was crying for a while after the end. Its hard to believe this series is over. I'm still not over AOT, it'll forever be my no.1 series. Attack on titan is a once in a generation anime masterpiece and is one of the few that truly stands on par with TV goats such as Breaking bad, the wire, the sopranos. Thank you MAPPA and Isayama.",10
andrescalderon-27325,16 November 2023,"I understand the cyclical aspect of what they try to say with the ending...and it doesnt bother me as much as some people. But three things bothers me alot. First, it reminds me so much of the watchmen ending...I mean, the need to villainize someone or something with mass destruction to ensure unity. I'm sure there must be other comics, mangas, graphic novels, film or series that does the same thing and did it first, but to me it reminds me to Watchmen. And it bothers me, because Watchmen did it so much better! Second thing that bothers me is Eren's reaction to his demise. Given the nature of the powers of the attack titan, he was acting so sure of himself, so asertive... just to crack like a little baby in his last moments!? I understand that people can break down, especially in high stake situations like this, but again, given the nature of the powers of the attack titan it seems rather pointless his outburst...point taken Eren was kind of emotional before everything came into motion, but not to that level... it feels out of character and cringe worthy. The need to make a more sympathetic villain is ruining bad guys. The words hero and villain has no meaning in grey areas... not every character must be a merge of the both... to me Eren died for nothing! Again, not because of the cyclical meaning of war among humanity, that i liked it... but he died for nothing in the sense of how he accomplish what he wanted... he died a wimpy villain try to be a martyr and without free will... and thats the last thing I dont like of this ending... if Eren regrets everything that he's done, but can't change it because is ""all for the better"" why not search for a better solution with the same friends that he so fondly remarks as wise and loving? And in the same thought, if he can't change it because of how the powers of the attack titan worked, who put everything in motion?either way, Eren give up his free will as a fool or there's not an answer to all this mess and that is just bad writing. On a technical level the music, the battles and the voice acting, everything was great as always... and the story arcs and closure of other characters were good. It's not a great ending for me, but it's not bad by any means...",5
baluyutdonpaolo-11824,14 November 2023,"I have to say, this actually made me cry especially when Levi's scene at the end, ""Hey guys. Were you all watching that? It seems that this is how it ends. The goal that you all devoted your hearts to."" It gave a lot of feels because he is the lastI noticed that some panels were changed but still fits the story. MAPPA did their best in creating this finale and will improve more once creating the Blu-Ray. I also love the final ODM gear scene of Levi and Mikasa, that scene was awesome. For me, it tells us no matter how peaceful the world is, there will always be conflict.Overall, the final chapters deliver the best ending to this masterpiece. Thank you for 10 years Attack on Titan, it has been an honor to all the fans of this show. The End...",10
xxisooodyxx,13 November 2023,The end of this masterpiece the greatest show ever i've really enjoyed of every episode on this show and now we can say goodbye Attack On Titan amazing from everything plot twist story characters write is really hurt to see ur favorite show end thanks for isiyama for this amazing show we really give us a masterpiece show I really liked it. Really love it i enjoyed a lot in this anime from the first episode to the last everything written from the writer he was a plan for everything in the end i can see he is just on the top one he got the top one and still in the top one thanks for studio mappa and wit to animated this masterpiece.,10
yourlittletsun,13 November 2023,"A realistic ending that left many plotholes. The first time I finished watching this last episode, I was confused and upset that my favorite character died. Well, eventually EVERYONE died in the end right?The animation and nostalgic soundtracks carried this episode. Although, I still wished they could've done better pacing in the anime. It jumped from places to places too quickly. What was that worm? Why was Ymir in love with the abusive King? Did Mikasa WALK all the way back to Paradis??? Was Levi outside Paradis with Gabi and Falco? There are so many questions in my head left unanswered.Even if Eren was being a realistic character during his breakdown, I still wished they erased that from the anime and changed it to a more calming confession. I think the sudden outburst was kind of cringe.I wish they could've find a better reasoning to free Ymir than her sudden LOVE for the KING. Even until now, I still felt weird about it. Sorry, but I just thought Isayama was trying so hard to pull another plot twist that just died like that. Honestly, I believed he had always been a genius with previous seasons. So, what happened in here?Regardless, I still respect Hajime Isayama's work. The unexpected realistic ending gave a punch to the real world. Especially with the never ending cycle of hatred and war. This anime had shown beautiful metaphors and important morals.As an anime-only fan of this series, I couldn't avoid spoilers. Yes, I was spoiled about Eren's death and heard how manga readers hated the ending. After this episode aired, I could see why but I did not hate it nor loved it. I think it's not AOT if it's not painful.Overall, I would give this episode a solid 7.Thank you for the past 10 years of incredible journey, I will miss this series so much.",7
domrlol,11 November 2023,"First I want to start off by saying Attack on Titan is still my favourite show/story of all time. I won't let me not enjoying the conclusion ruin the show. I started watching in 2020 but I have followed the story much closer than most. I watched videos after videos about this show and I eventually became a manga reader in 2021. I joined the hype of the last chapters but unfortunately chapters 137 and onward fall short. I'll explain why I think they are bad and also why the anime plot-wise does it even worse.However I want to start with the good things about this episode, the anime adaptation is stunning. The animation has a massive step up from the previous parts done by MAPPA and doesn't disappoint at all. Some of the scenes in this final episode are some of the best in the series. To go with the visuals the music choices were very good for the most part, bringing back many classics from the WIT days. Unfortunately that's where my pros end.My biggest problem with this ending is the character assassination of Eren. I'm not just talking about the Eren and Armin scene either, Eren makes terrible decisions in the end which I will get to. But before I do that I want to mention the attempt to cover up Eren making bad decisions in the Anime was because he was simply an idiot with too much power. It's disgusting. Either Isayama or someone at MAPPA chose to do this to cover up the flaws of this ending.Let's get into the Eren and Armin conversation and
what the hell happened with the writing. Like a lot of people seem to think, I do not think Erens outburst was in line with his character at all. Sure, Eren always had his moments when he started crying but here he cries about Mikasa. Eren and Mikasa didn't have a romantic relationship at all throughout the series. The only time it's seriously brought up is when Eren asks her ""what am I to you?"", and Mikasa couldn't even confess to him. And before someone says that if she said she loves him that they would run away to the cabin as shown in the ""alternate timeline"", no that is not an alternate timeline, that is simply a memory made by Eren given to Mikasa right before she kills him. He said he hated her, and he meant it, the dialogue was written in a way that he actually meant what he said. Eren Jaeger was retconned. He wasn't pretending in his private conversations with Historia and Floch, he wasn't pretending at the table scene, he wasn't pretending. Eren wanted to free Paradis Island, not just his friends like the Finale makes it out to be. He failed to save Paradis because of his terrible 80% plan. Out of all the options Eren supposedly had tested (the Armin conversation implies this), he picked the worst one. The Euthanasia Plan was better, 100% Rumbling was better and you could put in an argument that the 50 year plan was better also. Eren failed his nation. He killed 80% of humanity (including his own mother) just so all his friends could live long lives (oh wait, except from Sasha). His answer to Armin asking why was that he doesn't know and he just felt like he had to do it. What is that, is that Eren? Really? One of the best main characters I've ever seen has just said that. It gets even worse when he says he is an idiot with too much power, I thought AOT was deeper than this, It's a terrible way to sum up Erens character. Yes Eren was an angry stupid child that wanted to kill in the beginning but he learns that titans are humans and that the humans fighting him are the same as him. When Reiner talks to Eren in the basement about when he said that he would kill him and Bertholdt in the worst possible way, Eren simply says that he vaguely remembers saying that, implying that he doesn't think like that anymore. He isn't just an idiot who kills for the sake of killing, he isn't mentally ill, I don't want to hear this. Armin's famous quote about becoming a monster to overcome one is thrown out the window because it just doesn't fit in anymore. 100% Rumbling was the way to go, I don't want to sound like a maniac but if Eren has already killed so much people with his motivations, what's 20% more? With the 100% Rumbling Eren would have lived and if HE TOLD HIS CLOSEST FRIENDS ON PARADIS they would have lived too. They would have lived without conflict like they ended up in the actual conclusion. Hell, Eren left them in a bad position. The Avengers are literally discussing the possibility of their boat being sunk because they are the ones that have to take responsibility and do peace talks. It was not explained why Eren told Floch and better yet why Floch actually agreed to him after what happened with Erwin. If Floch wasn't stupid he would have said that if you can't even sacrifice Armin then what can you. But thats just bad writing. Eren always planned to destroy the world and Isayama knew of this. It was implied over and over and over throughout the series. Maybe not the biggest evidence but the funniest is when the Rumbling reaches Marley and they spot the Attack Titan, Eren literally says to himself that he will wipe out every last one of them that's on this earth. Why would he lie in an internal monologue. Eren Jaeger was retconned and handled horribly in the Finale. From Hero to Zero couldn't be more true here. He simply failed. Attack on Titan deserved a grim realistic ending and not the Disney one we got. It goes against everything the show has been building up.Founder Ymir is also a victim of bad writing in the finale. She supposedly loved King Fritz (this is fine) and her seeing Mikasa kill Eren set her free. This set her free because she saw Mikasa being able to let go of her love for Eren. But WAIT. No, Mikasa continues to obsess over Eren for the rest of her life so this is really stupid. And okay even if this was just a breaking point for Ymir and she was able to just leave, then why couldn't she have done this earlier. She is the founder, she knows everything that was going to happen, she could have left years ago. Even if she didn't know what was going to happen she had a whole 2000 years to think about it. Isayama are you really trying to tell me that she could have walked away at any minute? This is really bad because either you wrote her to be the biggest idiot of all time and I don't think this was the case judging by what we've seen before the finale or this is terrible writing. And hint hint its the second one indefinitely.Lastly I want to speak about Historia. This is my last factor to this review but there is so much more bad to speak of about the plot in the ending. Historia became a pointless character in S4. Her pregnancy became irrelevant. Why was it such a big deal if it was with a random farmer? Why was she shown given birth during the horrid scenes of the rumbling (which were fantastically done btw)? It's sad to see a very well written character go to waste. Eren and Historia made a lot more sense, they had more in common than Eren and Mikasa ever did and they actually had meaningful conversations between the two of them. It's sad, really sad.Like I said I have plenty more to talk about like the problems with the Alliance (mainly the treatment of Annie) but I think I'll save it.Attack On Titan is still fantastic and I will never forget the rollercoaster of emotions that it gave me until the very end. I absolutely still recommend this show even if you are just interested in action. It has great moments that I will never forget. Overall I still give Attack On Titan a 9.5/10 because as I said I don't want to let the ending ruin it for me.I want to thank WIT and MAPPA for brining this great manga to life. And of course thank you Isayama for this masterpiece, I wouldn't have got through these years without it. That's it from me, if you enjoy the ending then very good for you! I wish I also did, but I hope you were able to understand my points.",4
classher,10 November 2023,The Eren-Mikasa love story aspect was too underdeveloped that it was not a convincing plot point in the last episode. The romance was always glossed over in previous episodes but suddenly it was forcibly used as a main plot device. Armin and Eren talking about love interests in the midst of a world-ending genocide feels absurdly out of place and highly comical. The creators slowly built up Eren's character but instantly abandoned all of that development as it was revealed in Eren's own words that he didn't even know why he fought so hard and why he did what he did and his mind wasn't even his own because it was clouded by the Titan's powers. Characters that did unforgivable stuff albeit not in the scale of the Rumbling were rewarded a happy ending to reunite with loved ones and to live the rest of their lives in peace and prosperity like a fairy tale ending which was an unwelcome 180 degree turn in the atmosphere of hopelessness and horror that was built leading up to the final episode.,2
naghini-31168,9 November 2023,"Alright so listen, I am not a fan of Anime, i've only watched a handful start to finish, maybe 10-15 max. But I do like watching series and no matter anime or not, the way this series was thought of and planned, i mean common, a MASTERPIECE. From start to finish, never a boring episode, storyline absolutely incredible ( I did not read manga or anything , I am just a regular fan of this Anime series) , WOW moments every season with plots so great that I couldn't even imagine. But to end like that, I just can't be upset - it is a perfect ending that i have never seen in other shows. I think the only bad reviews this show can get is from people that wanted it to never end because every season WAS SO GOD DAMN GOOD!.",10
spegani,9 November 2023,"I need to let it sink in for a bit, right now i'd probably give it 9-9.5, but i think after rewatching it i'd like it a lot more. I'm still rating it a 10 right now because of the really awful 1-star reviews though lol.As always, the animation was absolutely GORGEOUS, but that's expected from studio mappa. Also as always i still really enjoy the facial shading that they use (although this is present through this entire season)I really liked the narrative and plot twists they threw in, and from what i heard (and saw) the changes they made while adapting the manga to the anime were really good and made the characters and narrative stronger.",10
jbgshccf,9 November 2023,"Isayama you madman. Whatever that quote says about there is no Genius without a mixture of madness. Yeah they were spot on. I followed the show from beginning to end (including all the annoying 1-2 year breaks and change of Animation house) and to say it was all worth it would be an understatement. AOT is a Epic wild ride of an anime, with Isayama brave enough to ask difficult questions of his audience with such dark, adult & heavy themes such as genocide, nationalism, the consequence of sin and yet he still manages to weave in beautifully layered characters with their own stories about choice, freedom, fear and perseverance in the face of insurmountable odds in such a calculated, well-written way that it almost defies its Anime category and typical conventions of the medium. I highly recommend Attack on Titan.",10
zakmasterson-59436,9 November 2023,"For me I think this is a pretty great ending for this anime overall. While yes I don't thinks it's a perfect ending like some other anime I think it's an ending that leaves the viewer with somewhat of a bittersweet feeling while also giving the viewer a grim reminder of humanity's detrsuctive tendencies which I think is perfect for aot. I see why people dislike this ending but honestly if people were expecting a show like ATTACK ON TITAN one of the most cruel and depressing anime to have a happy go lucky ending where the hero rides off into the sunset they were watching the wrong show.Did it feel a bit rushed ? Yes I'll admit it did, and I thought some scenes during the credits were unnecessary and were kind of beating the viewer over the head with the theme, I think it should've been a bit more subtle however I think the final scene after the credits was awesome.Overall a very good ending to what I would consider to be one of the best shows of all time......",9
gnjwthfyjc,9 November 2023,"This episode had everything. Action, drama, fear, romance, great music, great animation and above all a great ending. This finale was extraordinary and has nothing left to ask. It was sad yet beautiful and showed us how history repeats itself, which what attack on titan has always been about. This ending has explained some questions we had like why when eren began the rumbling, he talked to all subjects of ymir that he was going to kill them, or why he left all eldians and armin and the others use their powers freely. There couldn't have been a better ending. I'm happy to be a part of this show.",9
prathibhanilakshi,9 November 2023,"You may disagree with me, but I have to be honest here. I have loved this series since it started, but I cannot ignore the flaws in this final episode. It ruined the previous themes, introduced new ones without any buildup, destroyed the character arcs, and created many plot holes. It made the whole series pointless, because nothing that happened before mattered in the end. Here are some of the problems I had with this episode:The Hallucigenia's death was illogical. It seemed to die because Eren died, but that contradicts its history. It lived for a long time without a host in a tree before Ymir touched it. It also disappeared out of nowhere, even though it was a huge threat in the previous chapter. The only explanation is that Ymir wanted it to die, but that raises more questions about the origin and power of the founder (which we thought came from the worm).The return of the past shifters to help Armin was a cheap deus ex machina. It had no logical explanation, except to please the fans.Eren ""becoming a bird"" was unnecessary and nonsensical. It was just a symbolic gesture, but it did not fit the final panel.Mikasa's character arc was wasted. She had the courage to kill Eren, but she never moved on from him. She remained obsessed with him for the rest of her life, even when she had a family. What was the point of her growth?Mikasa somehow teleported to Paradis, away from the main cast, and buried Eren's head on the hill where they first met. How did she get there? They had no way to cross the sea. And how did she avoid the Yeagerists, who considered her a traitor and an enemy? I understand that the rest of the cast came to Paradis later, but Mikasa's situation made no sense.Historia's character was ruined. Why did she lie about her pregnancy? Why did she meet with Eren and ask him about her child, but never reveal what they talked about? Why did she look unhappy and depressed while pregnant, as if she did not want the child? Why did she say ""You need to take care of your body"" to the Farmer?The Farmer being the father was disappointing, not because I wanted Eren to be the father, but because there was no development or backstory for him. He was just a random guy who bullied Historia as a child, and then worked on her farm. How did they end up having a child together? How did Historia feel about him? How did he feel about her? The pregnancy was just a plot device to delay the inheritance of the beast titan, but it also destroyed the dignity and agency of the most important female character in the story, the QUEEN.Ymir being in love with King Fritz was a weak explanation for her actions. It was supposed to be Stockholm syndrome, but it did not make sense with her death. If she loved him, why did she let herself die? If she hated him, why did she obey him for 2000 years? And why did she need Mikasa to free her from her love? First Mikasa, then Ymir and Historia, this was a terrible message to the female readers about romance in this story.The rumbling stopping when Zeke was killed was another plot hole, since Ymir was not bound by the royal blood rule anymore. She was on Eren's side, so why did Zeke's death affect her?Ymir Fritz in general was a mystery, so she waited 2000 years for what?",1
vigneshthekingdon,9 November 2023,"1.author never confirmed about Mikasa married or not he spoil Mikasa character some fans may accept but some still fight for Mikasa married or not they spoil aot name

zorrodg-316-238330,9 November 2023,"A flawless finale to what will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest television series of the 21st century.Every character is sent off beautifully, each one getting a moment to shine in this final episode. The culmination of 10+ years of storytelling reaches its peak in both action and animation and remains unafraid to leave room for resonant, gut punching emotional beats that will linger with the viewer.Breathtaking, beautiful, brutal and bold in it's vision, Attack on Titan brings its story to a resoundingly satisfying conclusion with this final episode.Farewell, AOT. Thank you for your devoted hearts.",10
ak-58186,8 November 2023,"When I first read the leaks for the final chapter , I was disappointed . When I read the Korean raw , I was confused and emotional . When I read the chapter for the first time , I thought it was alright . Looking back and re - reading the chapter with the end of the anime fast approaching , I find myself liking it more and more . I could honestly speak for hours about Attack on Titan and its themes and writing , think the ending is just perfect - is overall good and fits with the themes of the story ,What a great writer
What a great story
What a great ending
Thank you Isayama for this great anime .",10
lindaoueslati,8 November 2023,"The finale was hands down one of THE BEST I've ever seen. The feels, the fights, the details, the animation. A lot of peak thrill scenes. The finale was a whole journey. Three days since its release and I'm still thinking about it, contemplating it, analysing it and rewatching it to absorb all of the details. Those who did not like most likely did not understand it's depth, the message Isayama intended to relay to us, the complexity of the characters and the little details. AOT is too genius to have a simple, straightforward, happy ending. Or else it wouldn't be realistic. This was the most realistic ending given to us. THANK YOU ISAYAMA FOR THIS MASTERPIECE. THANK YOU.",10
tdsearles25,8 November 2023,"We live in a time where a terrible ending to an epic story or a wasted sequel is almost expected now. Writers try too hard. Or they get cocky, lazy, etc. We have seen unacceptable disasters from Game of Thrones, Supernatural, Dexter, Lost, HIMYM and all the way to the direction of Star Wars, Disney remakes and even Marvel nowadays.So, it was refreshing to see Attack of Titan land its ending well. Now, its not perfect, and its a little depressing; but I think most fans will agree it was a mostly satisfying way to conclude this amazing story.The action and writing were fantastic. The tension, emotions, sacrifice, characters. They nailed the important things.Captain Levi stands out as truly one of the greatest characters of all time. This warrior, already a legend, comes back from the brink of death to play a vital role in the final battle, fighting through his injures to save Connie. Taking out Zeke once and for all. And at the very end its down to just him and Mikasa as the only two left. Him helping her get to the mouth to confront Eren. Then when its done he salutes his fallen Scout Regiment members and enters his life of healing and retirement. But still, I wanted more. To see more of his conclusion. Maybe receiving awards or passing on his strength to future generations. Something. I guess its hard to perfectly wrap up anyone's story that was so epicThere's not really much more I can add that hasnt already been highlighed by other fans. But I felt like this was about as good an ending as they could pull off. Thank you to the writers and everyone who made this happen and put together a fantastic and satisfying finish.8.5/10.",8
kroganslayer,8 November 2023,"The character development, the animation and the story, everything is on top of the sky. I don't even think that any other anime can be that amazing as well as engaging in the past or the upcoming years. Never gonna forget this anime, highly recommended or you'll miss this masterpiece. I'm gonna watch this for years. I wonder how did the writer even thought of something this sort of masterpiece, truly a genius. None of the new generation anime even come close to Attack on Titan, like some anime got peak animation, some got peak fights, peak story, peak fiction, etc. But Attack on Titan got every one of those and is highly underrated peak fiction anime.",10
htms-79066,8 November 2023,"The story ends with Eren killing 80% of the world and still being shown as a hero. Something is off. His motivations seem so dark and revengeful and suddenly he becomes the good hero trying to save everyone. The worst part is that every friend of his agrees with him. Sorry, it doesn't make any sense.And Ymir's motivation was because she was in love with the king? So poor writing. It could be anything. She is depicted as a suffering woman in love, while the king doesn't care. He took his tongue off and she was in love? It doesn't make sense as well.They built up a perfect show... until now. A decade waiting for this. Disappointing at least.",1
lanyawshyar-69699,8 November 2023,"Every beginning has an end, and here is the end of the best stories that has ever been released in the anime history.It's been almost 3 years since I first started watching AOT, and the fact that it feels like just yesterday and thats so sad :(.This anime series is a masterpiece,the characters, the unforgettable music, and the high quality of the show, along with the incredible world it creates, everything about this show was more than perfect.The ending... Like many others, I hoped for something different after reading spoilers and imagining alternatives, but witnessing the episode made me see it as the best way to close this incredible show. It's sad to know that Eren is dead, but the ending was still the best.And whether you loved or hated the finale, no one can't deny that Attack on Titan is one of the greatest anime ever made..
And one last time, Shinzo wo Sasageyo!",10
blakeefuller,8 November 2023,Attack on Titan is a story like no other. The journey to get to the end was unforgettable and beyond any expectations I could have ever had. While the ending isn't perfect I find it fitting in the sense it really drives home the message the Author was trying to deliver. It was never the titans that caused conflict. While Eren deserved to die his actions and their results are interesting and not so black and white. I do find by including the extended manga ending it erases the meaning of them since he stopped nothing. In the end this show was never going to have an ending for everyone but it serves its purpose amazingly and put to rest one of the greatest stories I've ever experienced to rest. Thank you for all the memories Attack on Titan.,10
baluyutdonpaolo,8 November 2023,"This is a really fitting end for Attack on Titan. This is exactly how I wanted to end the show; Great Action that leaves you at the edge of your seat, Story that torments/torture everyone, shocking also, and a Conclusion that answers almost everything.It really did copy the manga, but some of the scenes were changed but it still fits in the story. I can see the struggle and desperation of the group to stop Eren and the Founding.At one specific moment, it looks like they're in hell battling Eren and the Founding Titan. They have to stop the two from connecting while seeing their love ones turned into titans and started to attack. ""When will this torment ever end?"" I feel also for the characters as they about to meet their end. As we all know that Hell is a place where they torment or torture people, so the scene played or showed us the torment they had to endure or suffer.Overall, the episode is great. I will miss this one of the masterpiece anime. Thank you for everything. As for the heroes of the story, your sacrifices paid off, at least for a while...",10
finweiskopf,8 November 2023,"I still can't process this ending. This is by far the greatest ending I've ever bore witness to in my entire life and for the rest of my life. Attack on titan has been the greatest experience and is by far in my opinion the best written series there is. I expected nothing less than the great finale we received here. Hajime isayama you're an actual genius and I really don't know how you crafted one of the most beautiful series to exist on this planet but here it is. This show will never be forgotten, truly. I'm genuinely speechless, I'm at a loss for words to describe how amazing and beautiful this series is and I'm left in pure awe. If a series can do this to a person I think you've done the greatest thing you possibly can as a writer, make someone feel something so deep it leaves them at a loss for words from the pure impact of a single episode. Thank you Isayama.",10
matthewtoy-64956,8 November 2023,"Does Eren stop the rumbling? Does he kill everyone else? Neither. He stops where we left off - at 80%. It turns out, he doesn't know why he did what he did, except one thing, that he's still a slave to freedom.In a sense, only a program like AOT could make killing 80% of humanity a ""neutral ending."" Most of humanity and the earth is wasted, and Eren doesn't completely succeed in the Rumbling. This is what makes the ending perfect - in the end, nobody knew exactly what they wanted, and nobody got exactly what they wanted. In essence, the world ends in the same place Paradis began - endless conflict, with nothing really changed.Did Eren and the characters even change anything at a fundamental level? Was the world doomed to chaos with or without the Titans? At least for me, it seems so.",10
francis_angelo_g,8 November 2023,"It truly was a masterpiece. I find it perplexing that it received a one-star rating, as people should evaluate it based on this whole episode rather than letting disappointment over the ending cloud their judgment. The detailed revelation, intense action sequences, thrilling moments, and the exceptional use of sound and visuals. Mappa did a fantastic job in adapting this manga. As a fan, this anime will leave an indelible mark in my memory. My heartfelt gratitude goes out to Isayama and the entire production team, including the writer, sounds, music, voice actors, and visual artists behind this exceptional anime. Thank you for the journey!",10
old_school_boston,7 November 2023,"I'm so glad i never spent the time reading the manga. I'd be really upset spending that much time on this story to have that utterly terrible ending. I knew as soon as they started mentioning in earlier seasons that Eren could see the future and past that there was no way this was going to have a good ending. The explanations of why are so lazy and cliché. I'm so disappointed because I was very much on the bandwagon of this being one of the best Shonen's out there. With this ending this show pretty much doesn't exist for me, on to the next i suppose. The absolutely only saving factor was that in the end, it was Baseball that saved the world. Go Rangers.",2
rishatkhan,7 November 2023,"I think the killing of 80% of humanities was the only way founder Ymir would get freedom from the path. Thats why she planned all these to reach to this conclusion of Killing Eren With Mikasa's hand what founder Ymir couldn't do which was sacrificing his love for others by Killing king Fritz. I think she controlled every titan from the beginning to find way to get free from the path but failed many time and Mikasa was the only chance Ymir had. I don't think Eren's will mattered or anyone else, only Ymir's freedom mattered even if 80% of the world had to be killed in that process. Some people were saying ""what was the point of Eren killing 80% of the population if they would still get killed after 100 of years"", Thats the point Ymir didn't care if the paradise island would get destroyed after killing 80% of humanity. Ymir only cared of getting free from The Path. *Mind Blowing*",10

If you understand anything about the storytelling and the meaning of Attack on Titan, you realize that this is the best and most logical conclusion for the series. I don't want to go into spoiler territory here, but just know that everything you've seen throughout the entire series comes to a close in a beautiful, yet gritty way that will make you cheer in one moment, and almost cry in the next. This show truly knows how to pull your heartstrings, and this ending is where it's done the best. An absolute masterpiece from every front. I think that Attack on Titan is a must-watch for everyone, and I'm glad that the ending stuck the landing.",10
mrdarkgaming,7 November 2023,"The main reason for the haight is the devaluation of the entire previous plot of the Attack of the Titans and the transformation of the entire manga into a stupid circus for downs. Everything about Ymir and Eren's murder of his own mother completely deprive the whole story of the Attack of meaning (since Ymir is the cause of the whole batch in general, and the death of his mother is Eren's primary motivation) and it is no longer possible to take the whole manga seriously.The second main reason: Isayama's betrayal of his own professional responsibility for the well-being of his creation and devotion to the idea, a shameful deflection under the worthless wishes of snotty female fans of the characters.Other reasons:1) A change in tone from severely realistic to pink-snotty, which entails huge gaps in logic and leads to a reduction in the plausibility of what is happening to zero.2) The author's disregard for the lore of the universe (Ackermans can overwrite memory, the worm just disappeared somewhere for no apparent reason, and so on, Eren can do something else.",1

Throughout the work, Allen from the beginning of the victim gradually developed into the perpetrator, and finally become the author denied the avengers and massacres, Allen's story is to warn people about the cruelty of war, but also reflect many other practical problems, this is the way God should be!",10
igorilich-75626,7 November 2023,"A good ending to a long story. An anime with a good dose of emotion, silliness, and love. A simple story of survival turns into a thriller. Both endings are extremely interesting. Some characters get the ending they deserve, some are downright pitiful. In general, Eren destroys all the Titons and his dream has come true and the world will learn to accept the Eldians. The ending shows how important mutual respect is, the ability to listen to each other, and how terrible Nazism is. Happy end with assumptions. On this positive note we come to the next ending with the post-apocalypse, the boy and the tree, the final ending is genius. It looks like the circle of revenge has closed with a nuclear explosion. We are waiting for the next season about the post-apocalypse. 9 titanium worms out of 10)

All the people that are hate reviewing don't take them seriously this episode really gets you emotional and it's a fitting ending to an absolute wild ride with this ending I think both sides should be happy whether you were rooting for Eren to kill the whole world, or for the scouts to stop them the whole basis of the show led up to this episode alone no wonder why it took years to finish this up, but well worth the wait. Would absolutely recommend this to a first time anime watcher thank you Isayama.",10
javanmscates,7 November 2023,"Attack on Titan is my favorite story of all time. Simple as that. However, when I finished the show, I was a bit caught off guard. I didn't know exactly how to feel because the ending wasn't exactly what I expected, so when I first review the episode, I gave it an 8 because I wasn't feeling certain aspects of it, like Eren's breakdown, Mikasa's dream that had me bamboozled, and the insinuation that the show just starts again. In contrast, on my rewatch, everything clicked. The breakdown is perfectly indicative of Eren's character, I just didn't want to understand that. The dream sequence with Mikasa is one of the most important moments in the episode to show the motivation of Eren and the influence of Mikasa's decision to keep her love for Eren to herself. I love that Eren's friends got to live long lives the way they wanted, and that although the cycle of hatred would continue there was a time of peace that was experienced by the eldians and Miakasa and the others. It was a very realistic and beautiful ending, despite me not really wrapping my head around it the first time around.",10

The story is so good and it tells it so well. All the characters mean something in the story and no character gets unnoticed, they all have an impact to the main characters and side ones. Eren's transformation into an antagonist then to a protagonist at the end of the episode is so well put. The relationship between eren, Mikasa and armin is perfect and better than any show right now. This episode is the perfect end to this 10 year show. The author/or whatever you call it is is a mastermind and (I know this won't happen but) I would somehow love a sequel!

This series had me hooked from the very beginning and through all of the expansion of the AOT world and the evolution of the characters it kept me intrigued. The action animation was intense and well choreographed/designed. There was a level of darkness and struggle that made for some heart breaking moments. But above all the character's relationships to one another ended on an amazing note. My first love was Naruto, but this 100% gave me another anime to I fall in love with.

blakesleyhenry,6 November 2023,For over a decade the show has amazed us and coming to a conclusion in the final episode showing nail biting moments with heartbreaking moments also from every thing leading up to this amazing to the final battle the tragic ending of eren dying and showing the future and what happens to eldia amazing way to end one of the best series of all time perfectly made along the way not rushed perfect pacing with great foreshadowing what no one could predict pure sadness but amazing ending to cap of the series with perfect action just wow and at the end basically showing a almost repeat to ymir amazing.,10
phucdangcontact,6 November 2023,"Sadly most people just want the ending as they want but ignore the meaning of the characters build up by the author.At begin to the end, he just a moron don't know how to give up and ready fight back everything to protect people around him. Even kill 4/5 humanity just for his loved friends can live long and able to have children. They're everything to him. That's it.Time fly, war still happen, people keep killing each other, thing ends, but love... love is last long from Ymir to infinity. Love slaved Ymir for thousands years and we all slaved for love some how. Love make us willing to be a demon, abandon human nature, ready go to hell, kill almost humanity to ensure that people we love can be happy. What's can be more powerful than love?",10
nataliekorzynski,6 November 2023,"I'm honestly super sad that my favorite show has ended. I had all the emotions, I was happy, excited, angry, sad and I was even crying and tbh I still am. I loved every part of this episode, especially the cabin parts, where eren gave mikasa and armin a piece of his memories.I loved how vulnerable Eren was, how imperfect and to a point, just like Armin said, pathetic. But that made it just more perfect.Also the music was always on point, it perfectly matched to the animation. It underlined the whole atmosphere to the point where I've got goosebumps.In addition, all the characters looked super handsome the whole time. Wether it was during a fight, or while crying or simply talking.I can only say that there wasn't a second of this show that wasn't worth watching and im glad I watched Aot.For a long time it was part of my life and I will never forget how much joy it brought me.Farewell, shinzou wo sasageyo! 🕊",10
auloni-22574,6 November 2023,"I know there's a number of people who dislike the ending, and most of them do so because the ending wasn't what their headcanon was, which was utterly ridiculous.This ending is a suitable conclusion to the series. Eren has been an amazing character, and so have the rest of them. This episode was so perfectly handled, even me as a manga reader got emotional watching it. Perfect music choice, perfect animation and perfect storywriting. The controversial scene was fixed, which I am very glad to see.Attack on Titan will forever be remembered as one of the best shows in existence.To the boy who sought freedom, goodbye!",10
bmythen,6 November 2023,"Attack On Titan has been consistently brilliant for the better part of the last decade. Episode after episode, was met with both critical and audience acclaim, with a gripping storyline, beautiful animation, fantastic score and a cast of loveable characters.Season after season, expectations were both met and subverted, with a fantastic blend of both solid and sound storytelling, and an array of shocking plot twists. Season 3 Part 2 is the gold standard for how to tell a story, and is in my opinion, the single greatest stretch of television ever made.With all that being said, the hardest part of making an all-time show such as this, is sticking the landing with a solid ending.I could not be more glad to say that I believe Shingeki No Kyojin has done just that.It was a roller coaster of a finale, with stellar animation, gut-wrenching character moments, a beautiful score, and solid writing throughout. It leaves the series off on a grim, but hopeful note, as we have seen so many times in the show before.Humanity will always inevitably engage in conflict. It is within human nature to do so, a theme the show has been slowly developing throughout.Yet, that doesn't mean that fighting for freedom and happiness is a futile goal. A better future is worth fighting for, even in the most grim of situations.Whats important is establishing
understanding and compassion, and banishing your own prejudice and personal feelings aside, in order to make a change for the greater good.However, that is not to say it is without flaws.Albeit, much better than the manga, the pacing started to pick up significantly towards the end, hitting the viewer with sledgehammer after sledgehammer of plot points, and leaving little breathing room for these points to sink in. A little more time to let these points be processed would've went a long way.While I think his conclusion overall was a satisfying end to one of the greatest characters of all time, I think Eren Jaegers intentions/motivations for doing what he did, could've been further expanded upon just that little bit more.Lastly, there was a notable lack of deaths for a show that is so well-known for its brutally bleak world. I think Conny, Jean and Gabi should've stayed dead, as much as it hurts. It would've been tragic for them to go, just as they were so close to achieving everything they had worked for. They would've truly embodied the ideology of the Scout Regiment, and even more so, of Erwin Smith.""And what of our fallen comrades. Would you say that their lives were meaningless? They were not. Their memory serves as an example to us all. The courageous fallen, the anguished fallen. Their lives have meaning because we, the living, refuse to forget them. And as we ride to certain death, we trust our successors to do the same for us. Because my soldiers do not buckle or yield when faced with the cruelty of this world."" - Erwin SmithHeartbreaking to see it go, but I'm satisfied and thought the ending was beautiful and fitting for what is, in my opinion, the single greatest story ever told.A modern masterpiece.I will never forget Attack On Titan.ENDING RATINGS

jewelkailasam,6 November 2023,"Why did Eren start rumbling and pushed his friends away?Eren chose mikasa and did everything to persue her into killing him (rumbling , saying she was his slave and he hated her was a part of it) just to show ymir that eventhough mikasa love him more than anything just like ymir loves the king and just like how Mikasa still hopes to be with Eren despite him not treating her right like king fritz . Mikasa has free will and makes a decision to sacrifice him for the greater good and stand against his wishes implying that humanity is worth saving over a single individual even if they are God to themHe sacrificed himself, his mother , his friends , family ( because that death is what made him the person he is and bertohld wasn't supposed to be attacked then) , 80% of humanity (he stated that it was the best outcome he could come up to get the things in this particular way to end it all).It was all to show ymir that she didn't had to be a slave , kill the king and put an end to the Titan curse.Eren got what he wanted.Eren wanted to live , be around everyone and be with Mikasa.Like he said , he tried multiple things but this was the best ending and he had to sacrifice him , his family , friends , 80% of humanity to attain peace.His wish of his friends living as heros and long lives did come true, but after they die , conflicts happen again , war happens again . Trying to say that conflict and war are inevitable and the boy discovers the tree , signifying that the cycle continues againArmin was the one who told Eren that the the world beyond the wall was peaceful and without the Titans they would be able to live a peaceful and Happy life.He was the one who incepted the idea of it and played a role in Eren's persuasion of freedom .The ones who hate the ending are the one who don't understand it.",10
DoctorDragon,13 December 2023,"The ending of Attack on Titan leaves viewers without much explanation, which is the main reason I read negative reviews among people.It's only natural that there are these two opposing viewpoints: some people like to be able to reason about what happened and reflect to figure out what the true message of the series was, with their own interpretation, while others want to be guided to the underlying message by the viewing experience itself.So I decided to illustrate my point of view, constructed by reasoning with multiple people and observing various perspectives:Eren dies when he kisses Historia's hand in season 3. From that moment, he sees the massacre that will happen, and he asks to himself...how is it possible for me to do such a thing? At the end of season 3 we see him pointing his finger across the sea and wondering if that is the solution. There we already had the clue about the character's evolution, with his gaze lost in the void and the future. When talking to Armin, we see that Eren tries to explain to him how he reasoned about his actions. He tried to change things, but everything converged there, and so he wondered what was the purpose, the reason for everything.The answer? There isn't one. He didn't do it for his friends because some died, he didn't do it for an everlasting peace because there is no such thing, it is a utopia. He then wonders if he is just a fool with divine power...but that is not the case too.Since he knew the future, he no longer had any freedom of choice.This is the cornerstone of the argument! He lost his freedom. And it is not a justification for the atrocities he did, but an indictment of war itself, the cause of all evil. Eren became a puppet of hatred and war.... And all that for a kiss on a hand.There was never any plan by Eren, because what ruled his actions were not his choices, and this from the very beginning of season 4! The author made us believe in a plan...which was really just fate itself. A ""dark fate"" we might say.I find this ending brilliant, a poem of horror and fatalism.Having finished the reasoning part, I would like to mention the wonderful animation, music and dubbing of the characters (original version). There were some truly breathtaking and tremendously emotional scenes: Armin scolding himself by looking at his motionless body, the baby in the crowd, the team-up of Levi and Mikasa, all the scenes in the credits, ...If you have read this far, I would like to thank you for your time and hope that this review helped you to better understand one of the perspectives of this complex and colossal episode.",10

DoctorDragon,13 December 2023,"The ending of Attack on Titan leaves viewers without much explanation, which is the main reason I read negative reviews among people.It's only natural that there are these two opposing viewpoints: some people like to be able to reason about what happened and reflect to figure out what the true message of the series was, with their own interpretation, while others want to be guided to the underlying message by the viewing experience itself.So I decided to illustrate my point of view, constructed by reasoning with multiple people and observing various perspectives:Eren dies when he kisses Historia's hand in season 3. From that moment, he sees the massacre that will happen, and he asks to himself...how is it possible for me to do such a thing? At the end of season 3 we see him pointing his finger across the sea and wondering if that is the solution. There we already had the clue about the character's evolution, with his gaze lost in the void and the future. When talking to Armin, we see that Eren tries to explain to him how he reasoned about his actions. He tried to change things, but everything converged there, and so he wondered what was the purpose, the reason for everything.The answer? There isn't one. He didn't do it for his friends because some died, he didn't do it for an everlasting peace because there is no such thing, it is a utopia. He then wonders if he is just a fool with divine power...but that is not the case too.Since he knew the future, he no longer had any freedom of choice.This is the cornerstone of the argument! He lost his freedom. And it is not a justification for the atrocities he did, but an indictment of war itself, the cause of all evil. Eren became a puppet of hatred and war.... And all that for a kiss on a hand.There was never any plan by Eren, because what ruled his actions were not his choices, and this from the very beginning of season 4! The author made us believe in a plan...which was really just fate itself.
